Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved options tied to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) have quickly gained popularity, with almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market. As of Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts worth $11 billion, which is equivalent to 50% of Deribit's $23 billion in open BTC options. This surge in demand for regulated crypto products is driven by US retail traders and institutional investors seeking a safer and more accessible option. While Deribit has traditionally held the leading position in the crypto options market, IBIT options are now challenging its dominance. According to Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers, the activation of IBIT options has created positive ripple effects for the industry by introducing new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of Bitcoin's price and whether its recent weakness is likely to continue. According to the article, Monday's price action suggests that Bitcoin may have reached a bottom, as it rebounded from intraday lows to reach $94,000 by the end of the day. This rebound was accompanied by a "long-legged Doji candle," which is often seen as a signal of a potential bottom.

The article notes that this pattern has emerged at a key support level, which has consistently restricted the downside since late November. While this suggests that Bitcoin may have reached a bottom, confirmation is still required in the form of a decisive move above Monday's high of $95,900.

The article also highlights that corporate demand for Bitcoin has outpaced new supply, suggesting a bullish demand-supply dynamic. However, market participants are now focused on signs of stability ahead of Wednesday's U.S. CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations and potentially impact Bitcoin's price.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to assess whether crypto assets are securities or not. The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit partially sided with Coinbase, saying that instead of forcing the agency to make a rule, it should just explain its position on crypto assets unequivocally.

The ruling was seen as a blow to the SEC and its current chair, Gary Gensler, who is stepping down in January. The court called the SEC's actions "arbitrary and capricious" and noted that if the agency were to promulgate a rule banning crypto assets, it would likely face legal challenges.

The ruling could create an opportunity for the SEC's new leadership to change its course on crypto oversight. The new chair, Paul Atkins, could use this demand as an opening to provide clearer guidance on how to assess whether crypto assets are securities or not. Alternatively, an acting chairman like Commissioner Mark Uyeda could take action while awaiting Senate confirmation.

Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, welcomed the ruling and thanked the court for its careful consideration. The SEC has yet to comment, but Coinbase is expected to review the decision and determine next steps.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), has outlined his thoughts on pro-crypto policies ahead of potentially taking over as chairman. As vice chairman, Hill wants the FDIC to issue new guidance for digital assets and abandon its current piecemeal approach to regulating cryptocurrency in the banking system. He believes this approach has stifled innovation and contributed to a negative public perception. Hill also criticizes the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable. With the current chairman set to step down on January 19, Hill is expected to take over as interim chairman until a permanent replacement is appointed.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative view on Bitcoin, stating that it "has no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by criminals such as sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his previous stance, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who previously opposed bitcoin but later changed his mind. Despite JPMorgan's involvement in bitcoin-related financial products, including serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, Dimon remains skeptical about the digital currency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is investing in blockchain technology and tokenization, aiming to improve the current financial infrastructure. The bank plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities by the first quarter of 2025. These developments come as Donald Trump prepares to reassume the presidency and has promised a more favorable regulatory environment for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem has set a new record for mining difficulty adjustment, reaching an all-time high of 110.45 trillion. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which makes it harder to mine a block and receive bitcoin rewards. As a result, some publicly traded miners have had to pivot into other industries like high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The increasing difficulty also means that miners are under more pressure, leading some to explore alternative revenue streams, such as lending out their bitcoin at single-digit yields.

The article notes that similar patterns of consecutive positive adjustments in mining difficulty have occurred in the past, including during the summer of 2021 when the hashrate dropped by 50% after China's mining ban. In 2018, there were 17 positive adjustments leading up to a bull market top at $20,000.

While no clear trend emerges from these consecutive positive adjustments, they have historically indicated near cycle tops and bottoms in the past. The article concludes that the continued strength of the hashrate, currently at 775 EH/s, suggests that the network may reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving, which could further impact mining difficulty and profitability.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin (BTC) started the week negatively, dropping 1.6% to below $93,000 due to major investment banks reassessing their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts following a strong jobs report on Friday. The strong report led Goldman Sachs to push out its expected next interest rate cut from March to June, and other banks such as Bank of America and ING are also adjusting their forecasts. Bank of America is warning of the risk of an extended pause or even a rate hike, while ING says the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed. The article notes that Bitcoin has surged over 50% since the first rate cut in September and is now testing its support zone near $92,000.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company predicts that over 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Asset managers have already submitted 12 filings to the SEC. Potential products include a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, as well as combined ETFs for bitcoin and ether, and individual ETFs based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year was successful, with Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust amassing $53 billion in assets under management. The appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as SEC chairman and the resolution of ongoing lawsuits against crypto companies could lead to more approvals. Additionally, the growing ETF market is expected to see wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump's return and a team of crypto-friendly regulators in place.
