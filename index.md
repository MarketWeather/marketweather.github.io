-------------------------------------------------------------

11:05 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Italy's largest bank by assets, Intesa Sanpaolo, has purchased 11 Bitcoins (BTC) worth over $1 million. This is according to an internal message seen by Reuters dated January 13, 2025. The bank has had a proprietary trading desk in place for several years and also handles spot trading for other cryptocurrencies. The purchase of BTC follows the cryptocurrency's price drop on Monday, but it has since recovered, with its value increasing by 2% to over $96,500.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the growing demand for regulated crypto products in the US. Specifically, it highlights the success of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF-approved options, known as IBIT, which have already become almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market. As of Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion.

This surge in demand is significant because IBIT options are regulated and appeal to both institutional investors and US retail traders who prefer regulated markets. This has created a new segment of investors that have previously been unable to access Deribit's market due to its offshore status.

While some might expect Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market to be negatively impacted by IBIT, Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers believes that IBIT options have actually created positive effects. He notes that the concentration of activity in short-dated options indicates a demand for lower premium (priced) options, which has led to new arbitrage opportunities and enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

Overall, the article suggests that the regulated crypto market is expanding rapidly, with IBIT options filling a gap for US-based investors seeking regulated products.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of Bitcoin's (BTC) price movement and whether its recent weakness has run its course. The market saw a sharp recovery from intraday lows on Monday, which some analysts see as a sign that the downtrend may have exhausted itself. This is indicated by the appearance of a "long-legged Doji candle" pattern, which can signal a potential bottom. While this is encouraging for bulls, confirmation is still needed in the form of a decisive move above $95,900 to trigger fresh buying. Bears are now looking at Monday's low near $89,000 as the level to beat. The article also notes that corporate demand for BTC has outpaced new coin supply, keeping the market's overall dynamics bullish. Traders are now awaiting the US CPI report on January 15 to influence Fed rate cut expectations and potentially impact price volatility.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to explain its decision not to regulate cryptocurrencies, specifically in regards to determining whether certain assets are securities or not. The order came after Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, requested that the SEC write regulations to clarify this issue. A three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit partially sided with Coinbase's request, stating that the SEC must provide a clear explanation for its refusal to create regulations rather than simply forcing the agency to make a rule. The ruling was seen as a rebuke of the SEC and a potential opening for new leadership to change the agency's approach on crypto oversight. The decision also called the SEC's actions "arbitrary and capricious."

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the upcoming change in leadership at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the views of Travis Hill, a senior Republican at the agency. As the current chairman Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19, Hill is expected to take over as interim chairman until a permanent replacement is appointed.

In his remarks, Hill criticized the FDIC's approach to digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, which he believes has stifled innovation and contributed to a negative public perception. He suggests that the agency should adopt a more transparent and clear approach to regulating crypto activities in the banking system, rather than taking a piecemeal approach.

Hill also criticizes the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, which he believes is unacceptable as it hinders efforts to increase financial inclusion. He argues that regulators must work to end this practice and ensure that law-abiding customers are not deprived of banking services.

Overall, Hill's remarks suggest a more pro-crypto approach at the FDIC under his leadership, which could potentially lead to increased innovation and adoption in the digital asset space.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who previously opposed but later reversed his stance. Despite JPMorgan's own profits from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, Dimon remains skeptical of the cryptocurrency. The bank has, however, been investing in blockchain technology and real-world tokenization through its Kinexys platform. This move is aimed at reducing limitations in the current financial infrastructure, such as tokenizing real-world assets. Notably, Dimon's comments come just days before Donald Trump reassumes the US presidency, with promises to deliver a more friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.

Here is a summary of the article:

Capital Group, a large investment company with over $2.3 trillion in assets under management, has become one of the biggest shareholders of Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel industry investor that holds Bitcoin (BTC) as part of its treasury strategy. Metaplanet's share price has surged over 1,700% since adopting this strategy in April 2024. Capital Group also owns a significant stake in MicroStrategy, another company that invests heavily in Bitcoin. This indicates that institutional investors are increasingly interested in digital currencies like Bitcoin.

MicroStrategy Added 2,530 Bitcoin for $243M, Bringing Holdings to 450K BTC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has purchased another 2,530 Bitcoins (BTC) for $243 million, bringing their total holdings to 450,000 BTC. This is the tenth consecutive week they've increased their Bitcoin holdings. The average price paid for these latest purchases was $95,972, with an overall average purchase price of $62,691.

Saylor also made a presentation at the ICR Conference, where he recommended investing in Bitcoin over bonds, calling bonds "toxic" since 2020 when MicroStrategy started using Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Bonds have actually decreased in value over that period, while Bitcoin has increased significantly.

Meanwhile, Semler Scientific (SMLR) has acquired an additional 237 BTC for $23.3 million, bringing their total holdings to 2,321 BTC. Shares of both MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific were lower in premarket trading, with MicroStrategy down nearly 5% and SMLR down almost 7%.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The bitcoin mining difficulty has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than when Bitcoin was first created. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which increases pressure on miners as they struggle to mine blocks and receive rewards. The article notes that some publicly traded miners have had to pivot into other industries, such as high-performance computing and artificial intelligence, due to the challenges of mining bitcoin alone.

The article also mentions that MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy more bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out their bitcoin to earn a single-digit yield. The author notes that this type of record-breaking difficulty adjustment has occurred before, during the summer of 2021, shortly after the China mining ban, which led to a series of consecutive positive adjustments.

The article concludes that while there is no clear trend that emerges when there are many positive consecutive adjustments in difficulty, it has historically indicated near cycle tops and bottoms. The continued strength of the hashrate (a measure of the network's processing power) is also mentioned, with some research suggesting that 1 zettahash per second can be reached before the next halving event.
