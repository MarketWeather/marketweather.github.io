-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price fluctuations of Bitcoin (BTC), which has fallen below $90,000 but is now above $96,500, up over 8%. Tom Lee, a bitcoin bull and head of research at Fundstrat, views this correction as normal, stating that a 15% drop from its highs is typical for a volatile asset. Lee notes that the current drawdowns are relatively mild compared to previous bull market corrections, which saw drops of up to 50%. He identifies $70,000 and $50,000 as key support levels, using Fibonacci levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%) to predict potential price movements. Despite the short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's performance in 2025, predicting end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The demand for regulated crypto products in the US has increased significantly since the launch of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT). The ETF's options contracts have already reached nearly half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, with 2.16 million open or active contracts representing a notional value of $11 billion. This growth is attributed to US-based investors who prefer regulated markets and are attracted to IBIT options tied to BlackRock's ETF. The popularity of IBIT options has challenged Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market, but Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers sees the development as a positive effect, creating new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. BTC's price initially fell below a key support zone of $90,000-$93,000 due to concerns over potential rate hikes following a strong jobs report, but quickly rebounded to $94,000 by the end of the day. The long-legged Doji candle that formed is often seen as a signal of downtrend exhaustion and potentially a bottom, especially when it occurs at key support levels or after a notable price drop.

While Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is required in the form of a decisive move above $95,900. The article notes that BTC's demand-supply dynamics continue to lean bullishly, with corporate demand for BTC outpacing new coin supply this year. The market will be watching signs of stability ahead of the U.S. CPI report on January 15, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations and potentially impact price volatility.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to determine whether crypto assets are securities or not. The SEC had refused to provide clarity, leading Coinbase to pursue the issue in court. The three-judge panel partially sided with Coinbase, citing the SEC's "arbitrary and capricious" actions. While the ruling does not require the SEC to write new regulations, it does compel the agency to provide a clear explanation for its decision. This could create an opportunity for the incoming chairperson or acting chairman of the SEC to address the issue and potentially change the agency's approach to crypto oversight. The ruling is seen as a setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its handling of crypto-related cases.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), has announced his support for pro-crypto policies ahead of taking over as chairman on an interim basis. As vice chairman, Hill criticized the FDIC's current approach to regulating digital assets, saying it has stifled innovation and contributed to a negative public perception. He advocated for clear guidance on what activities are legally permissible and how banks can conduct them safely. Hill also expressed concern about the agency's efforts to pressure banks to shed crypto clients, stating that regulators must work to end this practice, which goes against the goal of decreasing the number of unbanked individuals. The current chairman, Martin Gruenberg, is set to step down on January 19, with Vice Chairman Hill taking over temporarily until a new permanent chairman is appointed.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware attackers. This is consistent with his long-held opinion, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who previously opposed bitcoin but later changed his stance. Despite JPMorgan's involvement in bitcoin-related activities, such as serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, Dimon remains skeptical about the cryptocurrency. The bank is, however, investing in blockchain technology and plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities on its platform by 2025. These developments come as Donald Trump prepares to reassume the US presidency, with promises of a more favorable regulatory environment for bitcoin and crypto.
