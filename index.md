U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impending change in leadership at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), with Travis Hill, the current Vice Chairman, set to take over as Acting Chairman on January 19. In a recent speech, Hill outlined his thoughts on pro-crypto policy and criticized the FDIC's current approach to regulating digital assets. He argued that the agency's piecemeal approach has stifled innovation and contributed to a perception that the FDIC is hostile towards blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Hill called for the agency to issue clear guidance on what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them in accordance with safety and soundness standards. He also criticized the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable. As the new Acting Chairman, Hill aims to address these issues and promote a more welcoming environment for digital assets in the banking system.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by criminals such as sex traffickers and money launderers. This is consistent with his previous anti-Bitcoin stance, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who previously opposed Bitcoin but later changed his mind. Despite JPMorgan's profits from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, Dimon remains skeptical of the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan is investing in blockchain technology and real-world tokenization to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. The bank plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities in 2025. This comes just ahead of Donald Trump's re-assumption of the US presidency, which could bring a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15:57 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Capital Group, a large investment company with over $2.3 trillion in assets under management, has become one of the biggest shareholders in Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel industry investor that has gained popularity for its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Metaplanet holds 1,762 BTC and has seen its share price increase by over 1,700% since adopting this strategy in April 2024. Capital Group also owns a significant stake in MicroStrategy, another company that invests heavily in Bitcoin, with approximately 18.4 million shares (over 8% of the company). This investment is notable, as it suggests that major institutional investors are increasingly interested in investing in companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.

This marks the 10th consecutive week that MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings. The average price paid for the latest purchase was $95,972, and the overall average purchase price of all their BTC is now $62,691. Additionally, Semler Scientific (SMLR) has acquired an additional 237 BTC for $23.3 million, bringing their total holdings to 2,321 BTC. Both companies' shares are down in premarket trading, with MicroStrategy's shares dropping nearly 5% and SMLR's shares falling almost 7%.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Bitcoin mining difficulty has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder to mine a block than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as they struggle to receive bitcoin rewards. Some publicly traded miners have pivoted into other industries like high-performance computing and artificial intelligence due to the increasing difficulty.

The article notes that this type of record has been seen before, during the summer of 2021 when there were nine consecutive positive adjustments after a mining ban in China. In contrast, in 2018, there were 17 positive adjustments followed by six more before a decline in the price of Bitcoin.

While there is no clear trend emerging from this many positive adjustments, it has historically indicated near cycle tops and bottoms in the past. The article also mentions that the continued strength of the hashrate (a measure of mining power) suggests that 1 zettahash per second can be reached before the next halving event.

Overall, the article highlights the increasing difficulty of mining Bitcoin and its potential implications for miners and the overall market.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin's value dropped by 1.6% to below $93,000 due to a strong jobs report in the US, which led major investment banks to reassess their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. The report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 256,000 in December, surpassing expectations and leading Goldman Sachs to push out its expected next interest rate cut from March to June.

As a result, Bitcoin prices are testing the support zone near $92,000, which has acted as a floor since late November. Other cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also posted losses. Traditional markets were also affected, with futures tied to the S&P 500 trading 0.3% lower and the dollar index (DXY) nearing 110 for the first time since late 2022.

Goldman Sachs expects the Fed to cut interest rates just twice in 2025, while Bank of America (BofA) fears an extended pause or even a rate hike. ING also notes that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed due to the recent economic reports.

The article concludes by noting that the December consumer price index report is scheduled for release on January 15, which could add to the hawkish Fed narrative and further impact Bitcoin's value.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a big year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Asset managers have already submitted 12 filings to date, with potential products including a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, a combined bitcoin/ether ETF, and products based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC chairman Paul Atkins and the resolution of ongoing lawsuits against crypto companies make approval more likely. With this growth in ETFs, institutional investors are expected to adopt them more widely in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The article reports that Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to the prediction market platform, Polymarket, citing it as an "unlicensed gambling site". The GRA warns that those found guilty of using unlicensed gambling services can face a fine or up to 6 months in jail. This follows similar actions by Taiwan's authorities, who arrested 17 people for betting on the island's presidential election using Polymarket. Additionally, French gaming authorities have also taken action against Polymarket, blocking users from accessing the platform. Furthermore, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has launched an investigation into US nationals trading on Polymarket through a subpoena to Coinbase.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) may experience increased volatility this week due to the impending unlock schedule of several coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. According to Tokenomist, the weekly unlocks calendar is worth $3 billion, with ONDO accounting for a significant share of that total. On January 18, Ondo Finance will release 1.94 billion ONDO tokens, worth approximately $2.23 billion, which is over 130% of the token's circulating supply. This large unlock may cause market instability and volatility, potentially affecting prices. As of press time, ONDO was trading at $1.14, a 5% loss for the day and a nearly 15% decline month-to-date.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to divest several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest. According to financial disclosures, his assets are worth over $700 million and include a stake in bitcoin ETFs worth between $250,000 to $500,000. Other investments that could pose a conflict of interest include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and an account for trading China's currency. Bessent has promised to avoid any conflicts if confirmed as Treasury Secretary. As a pro-crypto advocate, he would face the challenge of managing the federal debt amidst Trump's plans for tax reform and deregulation.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol, which has seen significant growth and now faces backlash from the community due to a recent change in its yield-generating token. The protocol's USD0++ token, which represents locked-up funds, fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve, a decentralized marketplace.

The issue arose when the protocol's team introduced a new feature called "dual-path exit" without warning, allowing investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price or at par by giving up part of their rewards. This change triggered a sell-off on secondary markets, causing the token's price to plummet and the protocol's total value locked (TVL) to drop.

The community is upset about the sudden change in the redemption mechanism, which was not well-communicated by the team. Some DeFi users are calling into question the 1:1 exchange rate of USD0++ with USD0, as the new feature allows investors to redeem their tokens early at a lower price.

Despite the controversy, the protocol's team has issued a statement apologizing for any misunderstanding and promising to improve communication in the future. The incident serves as a reminder about the potential risks of DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving the agency in a week after a relatively short tenure. During his time at the CFTC, he oversaw several high-profile cases involving cryptocurrency, including lawsuits against Binance and FTX. He also played a key role in concluding enforcement work against other crypto projects such as KuCoin and Falcon Labs. McGinley's departure creates an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement efforts when a Trump appointee takes over as chairman. The CFTC may potentially surpass the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in overseeing US digital asset markets if crypto legislation advances in 2025.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations for stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal would apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset's value. This would have significant implications for how U.S. stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers operate. However, the future of this regulation is uncertain due to President-elect Donald Trump's upcoming appointment of a new CFPB chief.

The proposed regulation views stablecoins as a payment mechanism and suggests that existing law references to "funds" should include stablecoins and other similar cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it proposes that virtual currency wallets used for retail transactions should fall under regulatory requirements, including consumer disclosures and protections against unauthorized transactions.

Consumer advocacy group Better Markets praised the proposal, stating that it would level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms and protect consumers. However, others have criticized the move, saying it does not account for decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets. The future of this regulation is uncertain due to Trump's upcoming appointment of a new CFPB chief, which could lead to changes or even reversal of the proposal.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Kenya's government, led by Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, has announced plans to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a regulatory framework for the industry. This shift comes after previous warnings against the use of cryptocurrencies in 2015. The goal is to capitalize on the potential benefits of the industry while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers in December, aiming to create a "fair, competitive, and stable market" for cryptocurrency players and promote innovation and financial literacy. The country has historically been cautious about cryptocurrencies, but with the industry growing in popularity (8.5% of Kenyans own cryptocurrencies, according to a UN report), lawmakers are now considering legislation to tax crypto transactions.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Three Russian nationals have been charged with money laundering in a federal grand jury in Georgia for operating sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik were arrested last month and face charges, while Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov is at-large. The services, which aim to anonymize transactions and erase the public trail of digital assets, have been tied to laundering funds from cybercrimes, including ransomware and wire fraud. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of North Korean hackers' crypto proceeds. The Justice Department alleges that the defendants operated these mixers as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, making it easier for state-sponsored hacking groups and other cybercriminals to profit from offenses that jeopardize public safety and national security. This case highlights the ongoing controversy over crypto mixing services, which are seen by some as championing financial privacy while others view them as vulnerable to criminal use.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin network and Cosmos to enhance interoperability. This bridge will allow for zero-knowledge technology, which enables different parties to verify information without revealing what it is. The goal is to unlock value stored in BTC and enable transactions on other blockchains that are free from some of Bitcoin's limitations (speed and scale). Babylon Labs' staking protocol has a total value locked of $5.5 billion.

The development is based on BitVM2, which enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin. This allows for the creation of a rollup that can handle faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security. The bridge will securely transfer BTC to the rollup and back again, enabling deposits to be withdrawn.

This project has sparked excitement among developers building projects on Bitcoin, including those focused on bridging to other networks. Zero-knowledge rollup Citrea, backed by Galaxy Digital, deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet last September, which is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
