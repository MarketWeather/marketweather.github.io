-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Bitcoin's price has been volatile, falling below $90,000 on Monday but rebounding to above $96,500 on Tuesday with an 8% gain. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat and a bitcoin bull, sees this correction as normal and notes that similar drawdowns in previous bull markets were much larger (30-50%). According to Lee, the $70,000 level is a strong support level, and if it doesn't hold, the price could potentially test $50,000. He believes bitcoin will remain a standout asset for 2025 and remains bullish on end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the growing demand for regulated crypto products in the US market. Specifically, it highlights the success of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, which has led to a significant increase in demand for its related options contracts. According to data from optioncharts.io, there are already 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion. This is nearly half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, which has traditionally been the dominant player in the space.

The article notes that IBIT options appeal to both institutional investors and US retail traders who prefer regulated markets. This is in contrast to Deribit, which is an offshore exchange that has historically kept US-based investors out of its market.

Deribit's CEO, Luuk Strijers, sees the emergence of IBIT options as a positive development for the industry. He notes that IBIT options are primarily traded by US retail investors who previously did not have access to Deribit. As a result, IBIT options have created new arbitrage opportunities and allowed institutional participants to offload risk more effectively.

Overall, the article suggests that the demand for regulated crypto products in the US market is strong, and that IBIT options are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. BTC's price initially fell on Monday due to concerns about Federal Reserve rate cuts, but then bounced back to $94,000 by the end of the day. This price action is seen as a potential sign of a bottom, characterized by a "long-legged Doji candle" which indicates that buyers overpowered sellers.

The article notes that this pattern has emerged at a key support zone, where prices have consistently been restricted since late November. While Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is required in the form of a decisive move above the day's high of $95,900.

The article also mentions that demand for BTC continues to outpace supply, which is seen as bullish. Market watchers are now focused on signs of stability and waiting for the US CPI report on January 15 to influence Fed rate cut expectations.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to write regulations for assessing whether crypto assets are securities or not. The order comes after Coinbase filed a formal request with the SEC, which was refused. A three-judge panel ruled that instead of forcing the agency to make a rule, it should "explain itself" and provide clarity on how it assesses crypto assets. The ruling was seen as a legal rebuke of the SEC and came just days after another setback in a Coinbase-related case. The order may leave an opening for new leadership at the SEC, with Chair Gary Gensler stepping down soon. The decision also echoes language from a previous court ruling that rejected the agency's opposition to Grayscale's application for a spot bitcoin ETF.

The article discusses the upcoming leadership change at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), with Travis Hill, the senior Republican on the board, set to take over as chairman on an interim basis. Before his temporary appointment, Hill shared some thoughts on pro-crypto policies that the FDIC should adopt. He criticized the agency's current approach to regulating digital assets, calling it stifling innovation and driving banks away from exploring blockchain technology. Hill advocated for a more transparent and clear guidance on what activities are legally permissible in the banking system, stating that regulatory approvals should be acted upon in a timely manner. Additionally, he condemned the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to cut ties with cryptocurrency clients, emphasizing that regulators should work to end such practices and promote financial inclusion by allowing law-abiding customers to access banking services.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reaffirmed his negative stance on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is often used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This view is consistent with his previous opposition to Bitcoin, despite JPMorgan's involvement in the cryptocurrency space as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. In contrast, JPMorgan's blockchain platform has been rebranded to Kinexys and aims to enable real-world tokenization, which could reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's return to the US presidency, which may bring a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
