--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, a company led by CEO Michael Saylor, has purchased 2,530 more Bitcoins (BTC) for $243 million, bringing their total Bitcoin holdings to 450,000 BTC.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent increase in mining difficulty in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. The mining difficulty has risen to a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, which is approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than it was at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This marks the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, putting pressure on miners as they struggle to mine blocks and receive rewards.

The article notes that this trend has been seen before, during the summer of 2021, shortly after the China mining ban, which saw a significant drop in hashrate (mining power). At that time, there were nine consecutive positive adjustments, followed by a bear market for 2022. Similarly, in 2018, there were 17 positive adjustments before the price dropped to around $3,000.

While no clear trend emerges from these consecutive positive adjustments, they have historically indicated near cycle tops and bottoms in the past. The article also mentions that the hashrate (mining power) is currently at a 7-day moving average of 775 EH/s, with some research suggesting that it could reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving.

The increased mining difficulty and pressure on miners have led some publicly traded miners to pivot into other industries, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy bitcoin and optimize revenue by lending out their bitcoin to obtain single-digit yields.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped significantly after a strong US jobs report was released, leading major investment banks to reassess their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. The report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 256,000 in December, exceeding expectations and prompting Goldman Sachs to push out the next interest rate cut to June from March.

As a result, BTC prices fell below $93,000, representing a 1.6% drop on the day. Other major coins like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also posted losses, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down over 3%. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 traded lower, pointing to an extension of Friday's 1.5% drop.

The strong jobs report led some analysts to suggest that the Fed may not cut interest rates as much as previously expected, or even consider a rate hike in the future. Bank of America (BofA) is particularly concerned about the possibility of an extended pause from the Fed, while ING notes that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause.

The article also mentions the release of the December consumer price index report on January 15, which could have a significant impact on the markets and the Fed's interest rate decisions.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of financial services giant Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 12 crypto ETFs may launch in the US if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with potential products including a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, a combined bitcoin/ether ETF, and ETFs based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report suggests that the approval of these new ETFs is more likely with crypto-friendly regulators in place, including the appointment of Paul Atkins as chairman of the SEC. This could lead to wider adoption by institutional investors and continued growth in the ETF market.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform, citing that it is an "illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider". The GRA warns that individuals found guilty of using the platform could face fines up to SGD 10,000 or a jail sentence of up to 6 months. This move follows similar actions by authorities in Taiwan, France, and the US. In Taiwan, law enforcement arrested 17 people for betting on Polymarket during the country's recent presidential election, which is prohibited under local laws.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses an upcoming event that could bring volatility to the market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). The "token unlock schedule" will release billions of dollars worth of supply for several coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. Specifically, ONDO is expected to free up 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion on January 18, which is a significant amount considering its daily trading volume has been around $250-300 million. The article notes that this type of unlock can sometimes lead to market instability and volatility. As of the writing, ONDO's price had fallen to its lowest level since December 2, representing a 5% loss for the day and a 15% decline in the month-to-date.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to sell some of his assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest. According to a report by The New York Times, Bessent has filed ethics and financial disclosures, revealing over $700 million in assets, including an investment in Bitcoin ETFs worth between $250,000 and $500,000. Other investments that could pose a conflict of interest include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in the conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent will be tasked with managing the federal debt and implementing Trump's tax plans, including extending expiring tax cuts and eliminating taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the controversy surrounding Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that has seen significant growth and adoption recently. The protocol's yield-generating token, USD0++, was redesigned to allow investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a discounted price, which caught many off guard. This change triggered a sell-off on secondary markets, causing the value of USD0++ to fall below 90 cents from its usual $1 peg.

The controversy arose because some liquidity providers and borrowers had hardcoded the token's price to be worth $1, making them vulnerable to losses when the price dropped. Many in the DeFi community felt that the protocol's team did not communicate the change effectively or provide sufficient warning, leading to a sense of betrayal among investors.

The Usual Protocol team has apologized for the misunderstanding and emphasized that the change was communicated in advance, although they acknowledged that the communication could have been better. The episode serves as a reminder of the risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields and rely on token incentives and rewards flywheels.

In the aftermath, the protocol's total value locked (TVL) has dropped below $1.6 billion, and investors are more cautious about investing in Usual Protocol. The episode highlights the importance of transparency and effective communication in DeFi projects to avoid market panic and maintain trust among users.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position after a relatively short tenure. During his time at the agency, he oversaw several high-profile cases related to cryptocurrencies, including lawsuits against Binance and FTX. He also played a key role in securing recoveries for victims of FTX's collapse, which was described as the largest recovery in CFTC history. McGinley's departure opens up an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement efforts when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. The CFTC has been a key player in regulating digital assets, and its chairman may play a crucial role if crypto legislation advances in 2025.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations for stablecoin issuers and wallet providers, which could have significant implications for the digital currency industry. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to the value of a steady asset, such as the US dollar. This would require institutions that provide these accounts to make consumer disclosures, protect against unauthorized transactions, and allow for cancellation of improper transfers.

The proposal is still in its early stages and faces uncertainty due to the upcoming change in administration with Donald Trump taking office. The CFPB's director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily, but Trump has the power to appoint a new director and potentially derail the proposal.

If finalized, the regulation would consider stablecoins as a payment mechanism, and could also include other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. This could lead to regulatory requirements for institutions providing these accounts, which may conflict with the decentralized nature of some crypto operations, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

Some consumer advocacy groups have praised the proposal, arguing that it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, others, including the Cato Institute and Consensys, have criticized the move, citing concerns about the lack of consideration for decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The future of this proposal is uncertain, as it will need to survive a Trump-appointed leader's approval before being finalized. Even if finalized, the Republican-led Congress could erase the regulation using its Congressional Review Act authority.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya's Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, has announced that the country is preparing legislation to legalize cryptocurrencies. This marks a shift from the government's previous warnings against the industry. The proposed legislation aims to create a regulatory framework that balances the potential benefits of the industry with risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers in December, which aims to establish a fair and stable market for cryptocurrency players and foster innovation and financial literacy. This move comes after the country's central bank issued a warning against cryptocurrency use in 2015 and lawmakers considered taxing crypto in 2022. With around 8.5% of Kenyans owning cryptocurrencies, according to a United Nations report, the government appears to be recognizing the growing importance of the industry in the country.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Three Russian nationals have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia for operating sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing services Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik were arrested last month, while Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov is still at-large. The defendants allegedly operated the mixers to launder funds, including those obtained through ransomware and wire fraud, making it easier for cybercriminals to profit from illegal activities that threaten public safety and national security. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for aiding North Korean hackers in concealing their crypto proceeds. The prosecution of these services has been a point of contention for policymakers and lawmakers, as some argue that targeting these services goes against financial privacy principles.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge with the Cosmos network to enhance the interoperability of the world's oldest blockchain. This bridge will allow for the secure transfer of Bitcoin (BTC) between different blockchains, including those that are faster and more scalable than Bitcoin itself. The project uses BitVM2, a computing paradigm designed to enable Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, paving the way for zero-knowledge technology.

Zero-knowledge computations enable parties to verify information without revealing what the information is, which is essential for bridging digital assets between different blockchains. This development aims to unlock the value stored in BTC and allow it to be used on other blockchains that are free from some of Bitcoin's limitations.

Babylon Labs' staking protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion, making it one of the most prominent projects in this sector. The introduction of BitVM2 has sparked excitement among developers building projects on Bitcoin, including those focused on bridging to other networks.

In related news, Citrea, a zero-knowledge rollup backed by Galaxy Digital, deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet last September, which is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
