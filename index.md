-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which has been consolidating between $90,000 and $100,000. Tom Lee, a bitcoin bull and head of research at Fundstrat, believes that the current correction is normal and that the asset is becoming more mature. He notes that drawdowns in this cycle have been relatively mild, ranging from 15% to 20%, compared to previous bull market drawdowns which saw as much as 30%-50%. Lee also highlights two key support levels: $70,000, which he believes will hold, and $50,000, which could be tested if the prior levels don't hold. Despite the short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's end-of-year targets, predicting that it will reach prices of $200,000 to $250,000 in 2025.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US-regulated crypto market has seen a significant surge in demand for cryptocurrency options tied to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). As of November 19th, the IBIT options had already reached nearly half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, with a notional value of $11 billion. This is a significant milestone, as Deribit has traditionally been the leading platform for crypto options trading, but its offshore status has limited access to US-based investors.

The IBIT options are attractive to both institutional and retail investors due to their regulated nature. Volmex Finance, a crypto derivatives protocol, notes that the growing demand for IBIT options is challenging Deribit's dominance in the market. However, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers sees this as a positive development, saying it has created new arbitrage opportunities and enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

The article also highlights that activity in IBIT options is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a demand for lower-priced options. Overall, the growth of regulated crypto products like IBIT options reflects a significant shift towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency trading.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. On Monday, BTC's price initially fell due to concerns about Federal Reserve rate hikes following a strong jobs report, but then recovered sharply from intraday lows, forming a "long-legged Doji candle" that indicates downtrend exhaustion and potentially signals a bottom. This pattern is often seen as a sign of a potential turnaround, especially when it occurs at key support levels or after a notable price drop. The article notes that BTC's demand-supply dynamics remain bullish and that corporate demand for BTC has outpaced the supply of new coins this year. Traders are now waiting to see if Monday's high of $95,900 will be broken to confirm a potential bottom, while bears are watching the level of $89,000 as a key resistance point. The article also mentions that market watchers are now focused on signs of stability and await further developments, such as Wednesday's US CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court panel to thoroughly explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on determining whether crypto assets are securities or not. This comes as a blow to the SEC, which has been criticized for its lack of clarity on crypto regulation. The judges ruled that the SEC's actions were "arbitrary and capricious" and granted Coinbase's petition in part, remanding the case back to the SEC. The ruling also called out the SEC's performance, stating that it had sidestepped the rulemaking process by pursuing a de facto ban on crypto assets through enforcement instead of regulation. The decision comes as a change is expected at the top of the SEC, with Chair Gary Gensler stepping down soon and a new chair appointed. This could potentially lead to a shift in the agency's approach to crypto oversight.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is about to have new leadership, with Travis Hill, the senior Republican vice chairman, set to take over as chairman on an interim basis. In a recent statement, Hill expressed his thoughts on pro-crypto policies, criticizing the agency's current approach to regulating digital assets. He believes that the FDIC's piecemeal approach has stifled innovation and contributed to a negative public perception of banks' involvement with blockchain technology.

Hill wants the FDIC to issue clear guidance for digital assets, rather than taking a one-by-one approach to directing banks' cryptocurrency ties. He also criticized the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that this goes against the goal of increasing access to banking services for unbanked individuals.

The current chairman, Martin Gruenberg, will step down on January 19th, and Hill will take over as interim chairman until a permanent replacement is appointed. This development may signal a shift in the FDIC's approach to regulating digital assets, potentially paving the way for greater innovation and adoption of blockchain technology in the banking sector.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin, despite the bank profiting from its growing use as a financial product. Meanwhile, JPMorgan's blockchain platform, Kinexys, aims to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure through tokenization of real-world assets. The bank plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities by Q1 2025. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's reassumption of the presidency, which could bring a more friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.
