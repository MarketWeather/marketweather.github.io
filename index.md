2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

According to a report by Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Up to 12 crypto ETFs may be launched in the US this year, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposed ETFs include products tracking the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, combined bitcoin/ether and other cryptocurrencies like litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report notes that the success of spot bitcoin ETFs launched last year, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which amassed $53 billion in assets under management, bodes well for the approval of new ETFs. Additionally, the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC and the expected growth of the ETF market could lead to wider adoption by institutional investors this year.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

The Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) in Singapore has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform, citing that it is an "unlicensed gambling site". Users attempting to access the site are warned that they may be liable for a fine of up to SGD 10,000 or a jail sentence of up to 6 months. This follows similar actions taken by gaming authorities in Taiwan, France, and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has subpoenaed Coinbase for information about US nationals trading on Polymarket as part of an ongoing investigation.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the upcoming token unlock schedule in the alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market, which is expected to release billions of dollars worth of supply for various coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. Specifically, ONDO's impending unlock on January 18 will free up 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion, which is equivalent to over 130% of the circulating supply and several times larger than its daily trading volume. This large-scale unlock could lead to increased volatility in the market, as previous research has shown that tokens facing unlocks equivalent to 100% of their average daily volume experience price fluctuations before and after the event. At the time of writing, ONDO's price had fallen by 5% for the day and nearly 15% month-to-date, with prices having been declining since hitting a record high in December.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, has filed ethics agreements and financial disclosures to reveal his assets and investments worth over $700 million. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, he plans to dispose of several assets, including a small investment in bitcoin ETFs worth $250,000 to $500,000. Other investments that could pose a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent will face the challenge of managing federal debt amid Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol, which has seen significant growth and adoption in recent months. However, the protocol faced backlash from its community after introducing a change to its yield-generating token, USD0++, without warning. The change allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a lower price than expected, causing confusion and leading to a sell-off on secondary markets.

As a result, the price of USD0++ fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve, a decentralized marketplace. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, also plummeted by as much as 17% before recovering some of its losses.

The controversy stems from the introduction of a "dual-path exit" mechanism that allows investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a lower price than expected. This change was implemented without warning and caught investors off guard, leading to market panic and a loss of trust in the protocol.

The Usual Protocol team has since apologized for any confusion caused and emphasized that the change was communicated in advance from October. The team also stated that the revenue switch will start distributing earnings to governance token holders who stake their coins for longer-term periods.

The episode serves as a reminder of the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. Investors need to be aware of the exact rules and trust that they won't change, or risk facing market panic.

Despite the recent downturn, USD0++ has traded recently at 0.91 USDC in the Curve pool, and the protocol's total value locked (TVL) remains above $1.6 billion.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position in a week. During his relatively short tenure, which began in February 2023, McGinley oversaw several high-profile cases related to cryptocurrency enforcement, including suits against Binance and the collapsed FTX platform. He emphasized the CFTC's focus on digital assets, saying the agency has "risen to the challenge" in a remarkable fashion.

McGinley's departure opens up opportunities for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement efforts when a Trump appointee takes over as chairman. The article suggests that sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger, or former Commissioner Brian Quintenz, may be potential candidates for the chairmanship position.

The CFTC has been working closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enforce regulations on digital assets, but if crypto legislation advances in 2025, the CFTC could potentially become the dominant agency overseeing US digital asset markets.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that could significantly impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal would apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset, such as the US dollar. This would require institutions providing these accounts to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers.

The proposal has significant implications for the way US-based stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers do business. However, the future of this regulation is uncertain due to the upcoming arrival of President-elect Donald Trump, who will have the power to appoint a new CFPB chief. The current director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily.

The proposed regulations would classify stablecoins as a payment mechanism and require institutions providing these accounts to comply with EFTA requirements. This could also include other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The proposal suggests that the term "funds" should include stablecoins and any other fungible assets used as a medium of exchange or means of paying for goods and services.

Consumer advocacy group Better Markets applauded the proposal, saying it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, some critics argue that the proposal does not adequately address decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The regulation's future is uncertain, as Trump will have the power to appoint a new CFPB chief and the Republican-led Congress could use its Congressional Review Act authority to erase it. The proposal is currently open for public comment, but even if finalized, it would not be binding until a new director is appointed or the current director can complete the regulatory process.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies, marking a shift from its previous warnings against the industry. The country's Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, has emphasized the need for a regulatory framework to capitalize on the benefits of the industry while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers in December, aiming to establish a fair market for cryptocurrency players and foster innovation and financial literacy. This change in stance comes after years of caution, with the central bank issuing warnings against cryptocurrency use in 2015. Today, around 8.5% of Kenyans own cryptocurrencies, according to a UN report.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Russian nationals have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia for operating sanctioned crypto mixing services Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik were arrested last month, while Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov is at-large. The services were used to anonymize transactions and erase the public trail of digital assets, making it easier for cybercriminals to profit from crimes that jeopardized national security.

Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of North Korean hackers' crypto proceeds. Sinbad.io drew similar sanctions after it was quickly established as a replacement for Blender.io, which was taken down by authorities in 2022.

The indictment alleges that the defendants operated crypto mixers that served as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including ransomware and wire fraud profits. The prosecution of crypto mixing services has been a point of contention for US policymakers and members of Congress, with some advocating for stricter regulations to prevent criminal use while others argue that such services are essential for financial privacy.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest Bitcoin staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin and Cosmos networks. This project aims to enhance the interoperability of the world's oldest blockchain, allowing for the secure transfer of Bitcoin assets across different blockchains. The bridge will utilize zero-knowledge technology, which enables parties to verify information without revealing its contents.

The goal is to unlock the value stored in Bitcoin by enabling it to be used as collateral on other blockchains that offer faster and more scalable transaction processing. This initiative is part of a broader movement to extract greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to what's seen on networks like Ethereum.

Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion, making it one of the largest projects in this sector. The introduction of BitVM2, a computing paradigm that allows for Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, is expected to pave the way for further innovations and applications.

The project's potential impact includes enabling secure bridges between blockchains, allowing developers to build more complex decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Bitcoin, and unlocking new use cases for the oldest blockchain.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Crypto exchange Bybit has announced that it will temporarily suspend its services in India due to regulatory requirements. As of Sunday, Indian users will no longer be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. This is in response to India's mandate requiring crypto companies to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with anti-money laundering measures. Bybit is working to finalize its registration as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider under Indian law, which it expects to complete in the coming weeks. Once registered, the company plans to resume full service for its Indian users.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

The US employment market saw significant growth in December, exceeding economists' forecasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 256,000 jobs, up from 212,000 in November. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly decreased to 4.1%, down from November's 4.2%. This news caused a reaction in financial markets, with:

* Bitcoin falling over 2% to $92,800
* Major altcoins experiencing even larger declines
* US stock index futures dropping around 1%
* The 10-year Treasury yield increasing 9 basis points to 4.78%
* The dollar index surging 0.6%
* Gold prices moving modestly lower to just below $2,700 per ounce

The jobs report also led traders to reassess their bets on future Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. The odds of a March rate cut fell from 41% to 28%, while the odds of a May rate cut declined from 44% to 34%. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December and were higher by 3.9% on a year-over-year basis.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency market has seen a recent positive shift, with prices for XRP, DOGE, and XLM (alternative cryptocurrencies) recovering from steep discounts on Coinbase. The Coinbase premium indicator, which measures the difference between dollar-denominated prices on Coinbase versus tether-denominated prices on Binance, surged in early December as Bitcoin's price rose to lifetime highs. However, as the market became increasingly bearish due to hawkish Federal Reserve expectations, the premium quickly turned into a discount. Now, the prices for these tokens are back to being similar on both Coinbase and Binance, suggesting renewed participation from stateside investors.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Heather Morgan, aka Razzlekhan, has released a new music video despite facing imprisonment for laundering cryptocurrency stolen from Bitfinex. Her husband, Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein, was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft. The couple's case was featured in a Netflix documentary, "Biggest Heist Ever". Morgan was sentenced to 18 months in prison and will not have to report until January. In her latest video, she raps about her experiences and thoughts on the federal case, using her character Razzlekhan as a tongue-in-cheek commentary. The lyrics do not directly attack the investigation or court proceedings. The video's message is meant to inspire and make others feel less alone. Morgan has previously lamented that her reputation was destroyed due to public fixation on her rapper persona, but she hopes this new content will help her "misfit" audience feel more connected.

Bitcoin Registers 14 Green Hourly Candles, Longest Streak Since 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the unusual price action of Bitcoin (BTC) during European hours on Friday. The BTCUSD pair on Coinbase showed 14 consecutive green hourly candles, meaning that the price went up in each hour over a 14-hour period. This trend started on January 9 at 21:00 UTC and continued until January 10 at 10:00 UTC. According to Vetle Lunde, Senior analyst at K33 Research, this is currently the longest hourly green candle streak since at least January 1, 2017. While it's not the first time we've seen double-digit hourly green candles in recent times, this trend has left many traders perplexed.

Sentiment Readings Favor Dogecoin Gains as Cardano’s ADA Leads Market Bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the current state of the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Dogecoin (DOGE) and other major cryptocurrencies. According to analytics firm Santiment, Dogecoin has been quiet outside of a brief run-up at the beginning of the year, but has since shed 28% of its market capitalization, making it a potential contrarian play if markets trend upward again. The article also notes that large investors are showing increased interest in DOGE, with transactions over $100,000 spiking and futures markets setting a new record for open interest.

Meanwhile, the sentiment for other major cryptocurrencies is mixed:

* Bitcoin (BTC) is neutral after a recent dip and recovery
* Ether (ETH) sees bearish sentiment despite holding above $3,000
* XRP is bullish after an 18% rise in the past week
* Binance Coin ($BNB) shows neutral sentiment post-drop below $700
* Solana's SOL remains semi-bullish despite underperformance

The article also highlights some growth in the AI Agent tokens category, with Bixby, Cookie DAO's COOKIE, and ChainGPT rising as much as 50% on Binance spot listings.

Overall, the current market conditions may be ripe for risk-on traders to make a move, particularly on Dogecoin, which has shown potential upside given its low crowd sentiment levels.

EU's MiCA Rules Will Likely Boost Euro Denominated Stablecoins, JPMorgan Says
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

The European Union's (EU) new regulations on digital assets, known as MiCA, have come into effect and are expected to boost euro-denominated stablecoins. According to JPMorgan, EU exchanges will only allow compliant stablecoins to be used as trading pairs in regulated markets, leading to a surge in compliant stablecoins like Circle's EURC. On the other hand, non-compliant stablecoins like Tether's EURT are facing challenges and have been discontinued by Tether. The bank notes that under MiCA, stablecoin issuers must maintain significant reserves in European banks and secure licenses for trading. As a result, many exchanges based in the EU have delisted USDT (Tether's stablecoin). However, JPMorgan believes that despite these challenges, Tether remains a dominant force globally, particularly in Asian markets where regulations are less stringent. Additionally, Tether has invested in MiCA-compliant stablecoin issuers to maintain its presence in the EU.

Bitcoin Data Indicates Ripe Buying Period as BTC Nears $95K
-----------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin market and suggests that buying at current price levels could be a good opportunity for investors. Onchain data shows that short-term investors who have held Bitcoin for less than six months are selling at a loss, which is a historically bullish sign. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has risen to 0.987, indicating that these investors are selling at a loss.

Other indicators, such as the Market Value to Realized Value and the Puell Multiple, also suggest that the market has not yet reached its peak and that there may be more upside potential. A short-term investor ratio of 60% also indicates that the market is not yet saturated with buyers, making it a good time to accumulate.

The article also notes that economic data released on Thursday caused a correction in the Bitcoin price, but this does not necessarily mean the end of the bullish cycle. The release of U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) later Friday may provide further clarity for traders and investors.

In summary, the article suggests that buying at current price levels could be a good opportunity for investors, as short-term investors are selling at a loss and other indicators suggest that the market has not yet reached its peak.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Briefly Went Negative, Usually Marks a Local Bottom: Van Straten
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article discusses the recent volatility of Bitcoin's price, which has been stuck between $90,000 and $100,000 since November 18. It highlights how derivatives, such as futures and options, play a significant role in these price swings, particularly through the perpetual funding rate metric.

The perpetual funding rate measures the average interest rate paid by long positions to short positions when the market is trending upwards (positive rate) or downwards (negative rate). A negative funding rate can indicate a correction or even a bear market, as it suggests that traders are becoming overly bearish and liquidating their positions. Conversely, a positive funding rate can indicate a strong bull market, as traders become more confident in the price's upward trend.

According to Glassnode data, on Thursday, the perpetual funding rate briefly turned negative for the first time this year, which led to a leverage flush and a shift in sentiment before Bitcoin's price rebounded back above $94,000. The article notes that this is not an immediate sign of a price bottom or reversal, but rather a warning sign that traders should consider when forming their market view.

The article also points out that negative funding rates are more common during price bottoms and bear markets, while positive funding rates can occur during bull markets. However, it's essential to note that these metrics alone do not guarantee a specific outcome, and other technical indicators and chart patterns should be considered as well.

U.S.-Listed Bitcoin Miners Accounted for 25% of Global Network in December: Jefferies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to a Jefferies research report, US-listed bitcoin miners accounted for 25.3% of the global network in December. The mining profitability improved as the average price of bitcoin increased by 15%, outpacing the 6.5% rise in the network's hashrate (computational power used for mining and processing transactions). As a result, average daily revenue per exahash rose to $59,585, a 7.1% increase from November. US-listed miners extracted 3,602 bitcoin in December, with MARA Holdings mining the most at 890 tokens. CleanSpark was second, mining 668 tokens. The report also noted that MARA's installed hashrate remained the largest at 53.2 exahashes per second (EH/s), followed by CleanSpark at 39.1 EH/s.
