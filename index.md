Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. On Monday, BTC's price initially fell due to changes in expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, but then rebounded strongly to end the day at $94,000. This recovery was accompanied by a "long-legged Doji candle" pattern, which is often seen as a signal of a potential bottom or uptrend exhaustion. The article notes that this pattern has emerged at a key support zone for BTC, and that confirmation of a turnaround would require a decisive move above the day's high of $95,900. Meanwhile, the demand-supply dynamics for BTC remain bullish, with corporate demand outpacing supply this year. Market watchers are now looking for signs of stability before predicting further downside or upside.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered to thoroughly explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to determine whether crypto assets are securities or not. A three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the SEC's previous refusal to write regulations was "arbitrary and capricious". The judges did not require the SEC to create new rules, but instead asked the agency to provide a clear explanation for its decision.

The ruling is seen as a setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its lack of clarity on crypto regulation. Coinbase had requested that the SEC write regulations to help determine whether certain crypto assets are securities or not, and this ruling requires the agency to explain why it did not do so.

The ruling also takes aim at the SEC's previous actions, calling them "arbitrary and capricious". The judges note that the agency has been sidestepping the rulemaking process by pursuing a de facto ban on crypto assets through enforcement instead of creating rules.

This decision comes as Chair Gary Gensler is stepping down from his position, with President-elect Donald Trump's chosen replacement, former Commissioner Paul Atkins, set to take over. The new leadership may have an opportunity to use this ruling to change the agency's approach to crypto oversight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), has expressed pro-crypto policy thoughts ahead of potentially taking over as chairman. He wants the agency to issue new guidance for digital assets and move away from its current piecemeal approach, which he believes has stifled innovation and led to a perception that the FDIC is closed to crypto-related businesses. Hill also criticized the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, calling it unacceptable and stating that regulators should work to end such practices. The FDIC's longtime Chairman Martin Gruenberg will step down on January 19, and Hill may take over as interim chairman if a new permanent chairman is not appointed by then.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is used by criminals such as sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware hackers. Despite this, JPMorgan has profited from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, including serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF. The bank has also rebranded its blockchain platform to focus on real-world tokenization, aiming to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. This comes just days ahead of Donald Trump's reassumption of the US presidency, with his team promising a friendlier regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than when Bitcoin was first created. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners to maintain their operations. The increasing difficulty is one reason why some publicly traded miners are diversifying into other industries such as high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.

Historically, multiple consecutive positive adjustments have preceded near cycle tops or bottoms in the Bitcoin market. In 2021, a similar situation occurred when there were nine consecutive positive adjustments leading up to the bull market top. Conversely, in 2018, there were 17 consecutive positive adjustments preceding the bull market top and subsequent decline.

Currently, the hashrate (a measure of mining power) is strong on a 7-day moving average, indicating continued strength in the Bitcoin network. According to research, it's possible that the hashrate could reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event, which would further increase the mining difficulty.

Overall, the article suggests that the current state of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is strong and potentially indicative of a near cycle top or bottom in the market.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin's value has dropped significantly due to changes in market expectations regarding Federal Reserve rate cuts. Following a strong jobs report on Friday, major investment banks reassessed their predictions for rate cuts, causing Bitcoin to dip below $93,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index also fell by over 3%, with other major cryptocurrencies experiencing even bigger losses.

The article notes that the strong jobs report led Goldman Sachs to push back its expected interest rate cut to June from March, while Bank of America (BofA) fears an extended pause or even a rate hike. ING also suggests that the market is correct to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed, citing the upcoming consumer price index report on January 15.

In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 traded lower, pointing to an extension of Friday's drop. The dollar index also neared a 2022 high, with elevated Treasury yields supporting further gains. Overall, the article suggests that the strong jobs report has shifted market expectations and may impact Bitcoin's value in the short term.

-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report by Laser Digital, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These potential products include a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, combined bitcoin/ether ETFs, and others based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The report suggests that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The success of spot bitcoin ETFs launched last year, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, has paved the way for further growth in the ETF market. Additionally, the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC may lead to an increase in institutional investors adopting ETFs in 2025.

The article discusses the upcoming token unlock schedule for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) and its potential impact on market volatility. According to Tokenomist, this week's unlocks are worth $3 billion, with Ondo Finance's ONDO token accounting for a significant share of that total.

Currently, ONDO's price has been declining, with a nearly 15% loss in January and a 5% drop on the day.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, is planning to dispose of several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

Other significant investments that could pose a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and stakes in conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent would need to manage the federal debt amid Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, which aligns with his own advocacy for these policies.
