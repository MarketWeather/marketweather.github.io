Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the growing demand for regulated crypto products in the US market. Specifically, it highlights the success of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which was approved by the SEC and debuted on November 19. The IBIT options, tied to the ETF's price, have already reached a notional value of $11 billion, accounting for almost half of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market.

The article notes that Deribit has historically been the leading platform for crypto options trading, but its offshore status limited access to US-based investors. The introduction of IBIT options, which are regulated and accessible to US retail traders, is filling this gap. Volmex Finance, a crypto derivatives protocol, states that the growing popularity of IBIT options is challenging Deribit's dominance in the market.

Despite this competition, Deribit's CEO Luuk Strijers views the emergence of IBIT options positively, noting that they have created new arbitrage opportunities and facilitated enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants. The activity in IBIT options is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a demand for lower-priced options.

Overall, the article suggests that the US market's demand for regulated crypto products is real, and IBIT options are filling this demand by providing a regulated avenue for US retail traders to participate in the crypto options market.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. After a sharp decline on Monday, BTC prices recovered by the end of the day, forming a "long-legged Doji candle" at the key support zone of $90,000-$93,000. This pattern is often seen as a signal of a potential bottom, especially when it occurs at a key support level or after a notable price drop.

The article notes that Monday's price action contrasts with mid-December, when the rally stalled and turned lower from record highs above $108,000. The current price movement suggests that the downside may have been exhausted, but confirmation is still required in the form of a decisive move above the day's high of $95,900.

The article also highlights the demand-supply dynamics, which continue to lean bullishly, with corporate demand for BTC outpacing the supply of new coins this year. The market is now focused on signs of stability ahead of Wednesday's U.S. CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations and impact price volatility.

Overall, the article suggests that while there may be some uncertainty in the short term, the current price action hints at a potential bottom for BTC, but confirmation is still needed to determine the next direction for prices.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to assess whether crypto assets are securities or not. The ruling came after a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit partially sided with Coinbase's effort to get the agency to provide legal clarity. The judges ruled that the SEC's actions were "arbitrary and capricious" and ordered the agency to explain its decision, rather than forcing it to make a rule. This could potentially open up an opportunity for the new leadership at the SEC to change its approach on crypto oversight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is expected to take over as chairman temporarily or potentially permanently after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a speech on January 10, Hill criticized the agency's current approach to regulating digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. He believes that the FDIC's piecemeal approach has stifled innovation and driven banks away from cryptocurrency-related business lines. Hill suggested that the agency should clearly outline legally permissible activities and conduct them in accordance with safety and soundness standards. He also criticized the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable. With current Chairman Martin Gruenberg stepping down on January 19, Hill is set to take over as interim chairman until a permanent replacement is appointed.

Here is a summary of the article:

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, saying it has "no intrinsic value" and is used by criminals such as sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware hackers. Despite this, JPMorgan has profited from Bitcoin's growth as a financial product and even serves as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF. The bank has also rebranded its blockchain platform to focus on real-world tokenization, aiming to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's return to the presidency, which is expected to bring a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, a company co-founded by Michael Saylor, has increased its bitcoin holdings for the tenth consecutive week. In the latest week, MicroStrategy purchased 2,530 BTC for $243 million, bringing its total holdings to 450,000 BTC. This adds to its existing portfolio, with an average purchase price of $62,691.

During a presentation at the ICR Conference, Saylor recommended investing in bitcoin over bonds, calling bonds "toxic". He pointed out that bitcoin has increased significantly since 2020, when MicroStrategy adopted it as its primary treasury reserve asset. In contrast, bonds have declined over the same period.

MicroStrategy's shares and the price of bitcoin dropped by nearly 5% and $90,000 respectively in premarket trading.

Additionally, Semler Scientific, another company that co-wrote this article has invested an additional 237 BTC for $23.3 million at an average price of $98,267. This adds to its existing holdings of 2,321 BTC worth $191.9 million at an average purchase price of $82,867. Its shares also dropped by almost 7% in premarket trading.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent record-breaking development in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining ecosystem. The mining difficulty has adjusted to a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as they must work harder to mine blocks and receive bitcoin rewards.

The article notes that this level of consecutive positive adjustments has occurred previously during the summer of 2021, shortly after the China mining ban, when the hashrate dropped by roughly 50%. However, it also highlights that there is no clear trend that emerges when Bitcoin puts in many positive consecutive adjustments. It has indicated near cycle tops and bottoms in the past.

The article also mentions that some publicly traded miners have pivoted into other industries, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), as they struggle to survive solely through bitcoin mining. Additionally, MARA Holdings (MARA) has issued convertible bonds to buy bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out its bitcoin at a single-digit yield.

The article concludes that the continued strength of the hashrate, which is currently at 775 EH/s on a 7-day moving average, implies that it could reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of a strong US jobs report on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). The report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate, which led major investment banks to reassess their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. As a result:

* Bitcoin's price dropped 1.6% to below $93,000
* Other cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also fell
* Traditional markets, such as the S&P 500 futures, traded lower
* The US dollar index surged to near 110 for the first time since late 2022

Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America (BofA) revised their rate-cut expectations. Goldman expects only two rate cuts in 2025, while BofA fears an extended pause or even a rate hike. ING noted that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed.

The strong jobs report has led many to believe that the Fed may not cut interest rates as aggressively as previously thought. The article also mentions the upcoming December consumer price index (CPI) report, which could further impact market expectations and the direction of rate cuts.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report from Laser Digital, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company expects over 12 crypto ETFs to be launched in the US this year, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These potential products include an ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, as well as combined bitcoin/ether ETFs and those based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The report suggests that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2023 was successful, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust amassing over $53 billion in assets under management. The appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC and the expected growth of the ETF market are factors that could contribute to a high likelihood of approval for these new ETFs.
