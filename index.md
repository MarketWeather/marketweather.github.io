MicroStrategy Added 2,530 Bitcoin for $243M, Bringing Holdings to 450K BTC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, a company led by CEO Michael Saylor, has continued its trend of buying Bitcoin (BTC) for the tenth consecutive week. In the latest purchase, they acquired 2,530 BTC worth $243 million, bringing their total holdings to 450,000 BTC. This brings the average price per Bitcoin to $62,691.

Additionally, Semler Scientific, another company that Saylor is involved with, has also purchased more Bitcoin. They bought an additional 237 BTC for $23.3 million, increasing their overall holdings to 2,321 BTC worth $191.9 million. Shares of both companies have dropped in premarket trading, with MicroStrategy's shares down 5% and Semler Scientific's shares down 7%.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent rise in mining difficulty in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem to an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, which represents a significant increase from its genesis block level. This adjustment is the eighth consecutive positive one, putting pressure on miners as it becomes harder for them to mine blocks and receive bitcoin rewards.

The article notes that some publicly traded miners have had to pivot into other industries, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), due to the increasing difficulty. Additionally, MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out its bitcoin holdings at a single-digit yield.

The article also highlights that this type of record has been seen before in 2021, shortly after the China mining ban, which resulted in a series of nine consecutive positive adjustments. In contrast, during the 2018 bull market top, Bitcoin experienced 17 positive adjustments before the price dropped significantly.

While there is no clear trend indicating what happens next, the article notes that this many consecutive positive adjustments have historically preceded near-cycle tops and bottoms. The continued strength of the hashrate (775 EH/s on a 7-day moving average) and the potential for the network to reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving are seen as indicators of the network's ongoing health and resilience.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of a strong jobs report in the US on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). The report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls, beating expectations and causing major investment banks to reassess their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. As a result:

* BTC dropped 1.6% to below $93,000
* Other major coins like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also fell by bigger percentages
* The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, was down over 3%

The jobs report's strong numbers led Goldman Sachs to push out the next interest rate cut to June from March. This change in expectations may have contributed to the decline in Bitcoin prices.

Additionally, traditional markets were also affected:

* S&P 500 futures traded 0.3% lower
* The dollar index (DXY) neared 110 for the first time since late 2022
* Treasury yields surged by 100 basis points since the last rate cut

Several investment banks and analysts are now revising their expectations, with some predicting an extended pause or even a rate hike. ING noted that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed, while Bank of America (BofA) analysts said they think the cutting cycle is over and risks are skewed toward a hike.

The article concludes by mentioning the upcoming December consumer price index report on January 15, which could further impact interest rate expectations and the cryptocurrency market.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They predict that over 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposed products include a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, as well as ETFs based on bitcoin, ether, litecoin, XRP, and Solana. Laser Digital believes that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The success of spot bitcoin ETFs last year, which saw BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust amass over $53 billion in assets under management, is expected to continue with the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC chairman Paul Atkins and the potential for reduced lawsuits against crypto companies. This could lead to wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump returning to office with a team of crypto-friendly regulators.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The Singaporean Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered internet service providers to block access to the prediction market platform, Polymarket, citing it as an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed provider. The GRA warns that those found guilty of using the platform may face a fine of up to SGD 10,000 or a jail sentence of up to 6 months. This is not the first jurisdiction to take action against Polymarket; Taiwan has blocked its nationals from using the platform and arrested 17 people for betting on their presidential election. Additionally, French gaming authorities have also taken notice of Polymarket, blocking users in France from accessing it. Furthermore, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase seeking information about US nationals trading on Polymarket as part of an ongoing investigation.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) may experience increased volatility this week due to the upcoming token unlock schedule. The schedule, which includes coins like ONDO, ARB, and STRK, will release billions of dollars worth of supply into the market, with Ondo Finance's ONDO accounting for a large share of that total. ONDO is set to unlock 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion on January 18, which is equivalent to over 130% of its circulating supply and several times its daily trading volume. This sudden release of supply could lead to price swings and market instability. Historically, unlocks of this magnitude can cause volatility in the lead-up to and following the event. Currently, ONDO's price has been declining, falling 5% on the day and nearly 15% month-to-date, after hitting record highs in December.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, is planning to dispose of several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest. According to his ethics agreement and financial disclosures, Bessent has investments worth over $700 million, including holdings in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) worth between $250,000 and $500,000. He also has a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in the conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent will be tasked with managing the federal debt while implementing Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol and its recent controversy over a change to its yield-generating token, USD0++. The protocol allows users to stake their funds in exchange for rewards in the form of USD0 and USUAL tokens. However, a new feature called "dual-path exit" was introduced without warning, which allows investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price or at par by giving up part of the rewards earned.

This change caused confusion among users and led to a sell-off on secondary markets, with the value of USD0++ falling briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17% before recovering some losses. The controversy was fueled by concerns that investors were being "rugged" (i.e., taken advantage of) and that the change undermined the protocol's original design.

The Usual Protocol team apologized for any misunderstandings and promised to improve communication with users. However, the episode highlights the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. It serves as a reminder that investors should carefully review the terms and conditions of these products before participating.

Key points:

* Usual Protocol introduced a new feature called "dual-path exit" without warning, allowing investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early.
* The change caused confusion among users and led to a sell-off on secondary markets.
* USD0++ fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve, while the protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17%.
* The episode highlights the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels.
* Investors should carefully review the terms and conditions of these products before participating.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position in a week. During his tenure, which began in February 2023, he oversaw several high-profile cases involving cryptocurrencies, including lawsuits against Binance and KuCoin. He also played a key role in the conclusion of the enforcement work against FTX, resulting in the largest recovery for victims in CFTC history. McGinley's departure creates an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over as chairman. The CFTC has been focused on digital assets and has pursued dozens of major cases alongside its cousin agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If crypto legislation passes in 2025, the CFTC could become the dominant agency overseeing US digital asset markets.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset, such as the US dollar. This would have significant implications for how US-based stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers operate.

The CFPB's proposal suggests that stablecoins should be considered a payment mechanism, and therefore, fall under EFTA regulations. This could also include other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The regulation would require institutions providing virtual currency wallets to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow for canceling improper transfers.

However, the future of this proposal is uncertain due to Donald Trump's impending inauguration as President and his ability to appoint a new CFPB chief. The current director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily, but Trump could replace him with someone more sympathetic to his views on regulation.

If the regulation survives, it would require institutions providing virtual currency wallets to comply with EFTA regulations, which could be challenging for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that operate independently without outside interference. Some have expressed concerns about the proposal, arguing that it is overly broad and does not account for decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The proposal has received mixed reactions, with some consumer advocacy groups applauding the move to extend EFTA protections to digital payment mechanisms, while others, such as the Cato Institute, have criticized the proposal as "embarrassingly conclusory" and lacking consideration for decentralized finance. The regulation's fate will likely depend on the incoming administration and its stance on financial regulations.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies, a significant shift from its previous warnings against the industry. According to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, the government aims to create a regulatory framework that capitalizes on the benefits of virtual assets and service providers while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy in December, which aims to establish a competitive market for cryptocurrency players and promote innovation and financial literacy. The country's cautious stance towards cryptocurrencies has evolved since 2015, when its central bank issued a warning against their use. In 2022, lawmakers considered taxing crypto as the industry grew in popularity, with around 8.5% of Kenyans owning virtual currencies.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov (who is at-large), have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges relate to their operation of two crypto mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io, which were used to anonymize transactions and erase the public trail of digital assets. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding North Korean hackers in concealing the proceeds of cyber thefts. Authorities had already seized the computer equipment behind the services, and the charges are seen as a blow to the operation of these types of services, which have been criticized for enabling criminal activity such as ransomware attacks and wire fraud. The prosecution is part of a broader effort by US authorities to crack down on crypto mixing services, which some see as a vulnerability in the financial system that can be exploited by criminals.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge with the Cosmos network to enhance interoperability between blockchains. This project aims to allow for zero-knowledge technology, which enables verification of information without revealing what that information is. The goal is to unlock value stored in BTC and enable transactions on other blockchains that are faster and more scalable than Bitcoin.

To achieve this, Babylon Labs is building upon the BitVM2 computing paradigm, designed to support Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin. This will allow for bridges to securely transfer BTC between networks and bring it back, enabling deposits to be withdrawn.

The introduction of BitVM2's predecessor was hailed as a breakthrough in making Bitcoin more programmable, paving the way for faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security. This has inspired developers building projects on Bitcoin, including those focused on bridging to other networks.

One example is Citrea, a zero-knowledge rollup backed by Galaxy Digital, which deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet last September. This bridge is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), powering the Ethereum protocol.

Ultimately, this project aims to enable greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to what is common on networks like Ethereum, and extract value stored in BTC to finance other ecosystems.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

16:21 10 Jan 2025

Crypto exchange Bybit is temporarily suspending its services for Indian users due to new regulations in the country. Starting Sunday, Indian customers will no longer be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. The suspension is intended to prevent any potential issues with compliance. However, Bybit expects to finalize its registration as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider under India's law and resume full service once this process is complete. This comes after India mandated that crypto companies register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in March 2023, and compliance with anti-money laundering measures.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

13:39 10 Jan 2025

The US job market saw significant growth in December, exceeding economists' forecasts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 256,000 jobs last month, a major increase from the previous month's revised total of 212,000. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly dropped to 4.1% in December, down from November's 4.2%. This strong job market data has led investors to reevaluate their expectations about future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with bets on further rate cuts in 2025 decreasing. As a result, traditional markets are experiencing a pullback, with US stock index futures and the dollar index surging, while gold prices have decreased slightly. The bond market is also reacting strongly, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising by nine basis points to 4.78%.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

13:32 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent performance of alternative cryptocurrencies XRP, DOGE, and XLM on major exchanges Coinbase and Binance. According to TradingView data, the prices of these tokens have recovered from steep discounts on Coinbase in the second half of December, indicating renewed interest from US-based investors. The "Coinbase premium" indicator, which measures the spread between Coinbase and Binance prices, has surged for these tokens since early December due to Bitcoin's (BTC) rise to lifetime highs. However, as BTC's uptrend slowed down in late December, the premium turned into a discount.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, has released a new music video despite facing imprisonment by US authorities for laundering cryptocurrency stolen from Bitfinex. Her husband Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft, and both have been featured in a Netflix documentary about the case.

The song, titled "Razzlekhan vs. The United States," is a tongue-in-cheek commentary that doesn't directly attack the investigation or court proceedings that landed her an 18-month prison sentence. In the video, Morgan's alter ego Razzlekhan raps and dances while bound in red ropes, striking a sharp contrast with her appearance at her sentencing hearing where she was conservatively dressed and apologized for her role.

The lyrics are meant to be inspiring and uplifting to "misfits" who have been touched by Morgan's Razzlekhan content. However, the case has left Morgan feeling haunted by what she did, saying it will affect her for the rest of her life.

Morgan is scheduled to report to prison at the end of January, but will also have her computer use restricted and monitored. The release of this new music video appears to be a way for her to push back against the negative publicity surrounding the case and to connect with fans who appreciate her work as Razzlekhan.
