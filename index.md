Analysis: Prediction Markets Have a Gambling Problem
----------------------------------------------------

17:14 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are facing regulatory challenges globally. While they argue that their platforms are not gambling, but rather investment tools based on probabilities, many authorities outside the US view them as unlicensed gambling operations. The platforms have had to spend time and money convincing regulators that they're not gambling.

In the US, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) views prediction markets as a collection of event contracts, similar to weather derivatives used by farmers to hedge against crop loss. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have had issues with the CFTC, but Kalshi has been given permission to offer election-based event contracts.

The article highlights that prediction market platforms can be useful tools for forecasting outcomes based on probabilities, rather than games of luck. However, many authorities are skeptical about their activities, especially when it comes to sports-themed prediction markets. The article suggests that this type of activity looks a lot like online sports betting, which has its own set of stringent licensing requirements.

The author notes that there may be room for sports-themed prediction market contracts in certain industries, such as media companies looking to determine the value of broadcast rights. However, it's clear that many authorities are wary of these types of activities and will likely require strict regulation and licensing.

Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price fluctuations of Bitcoin (BTC), which has been consolidating between $90,000 and $100,000. Despite a brief dip below $90,000 on Monday, Bitcoin rebounded by over 8% on Tuesday and is now trading above $96,500. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, views the current correction as normal for a volatile asset like Bitcoin, citing historical drawdowns of around 15-20%. He notes that if the price falls below $70,000, it could potentially test the $50,000 level. However, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's prospects for 2025 and expects end-of-year targets to be met or exceeded, with prices potentially reaching $200,000 to $250,000.

Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's largest bank by assets, has purchased 11 Bitcoins (BTC) for over $1 million. This move further integrates Bitcoin into the traditional finance system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the growing demand for regulated crypto products in the US market. Specifically, it highlights the success of BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF-approved options, which debuted on November 19 and have already reached almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market. As of Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion. This is significant because it indicates that US-based investors are willing to participate in the crypto options market through regulated channels.

The article also notes that Deribit, which has traditionally been the leading player in the crypto options market, has seen its dominance challenged by IBIT options. However, Deribit's CEO, Luuk Strijers, views the development positively, noting that IBIT options have created new arbitrage opportunities and facilitated enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

The article also highlights the characteristics of the IBIT options market, noting that activity is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a demand for lower premium (priced) options. Overall, the article suggests that the regulated crypto product space is growing rapidly and is likely to continue to evolve in the coming months and years.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. BTC's price initially fell due to changes in Fed rate cut expectations following a strong jobs report, but then rebounded sharply, closing above $94,000. The long-legged Doji candle pattern that emerged indicates downtrend exhaustion and potential bottom formation, similar to what happened on December 16 when the uptrend ran out of steam.

To confirm a potential bottom, traders are waiting for a decisive move above Monday's high of $95,900. Meanwhile, bears need to break below Monday's low of $89,000 to regain control. The article notes that BTC's demand-supply dynamics remain bullish, with corporate demand for BTC exceeding the supply of new coins this year.

Market participants are now waiting for signs of stability before determining whether the price will continue to fall or rebound further. The upcoming US CPI report on January 15 may influence Fed rate cut expectations and potentially impact Bitcoin's price volatility.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to explain its decision not to write regulations on how to assess whether crypto assets are securities or not. This comes after Coinbase, a digital currency exchange, requested that the SEC provide legal clarity on the matter. The judges ruled that the SEC's previous explanation was "conclusory and insufficiently reasoned" and thus "arbitrary and capricious." While the court did not require the SEC to write new rules, it did order the agency to provide a more thorough explanation of its decision. This could potentially create an opening for the SEC's new leadership to change its approach on crypto oversight.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), is expected to take over as chairman on an interim basis soon, potentially permanently once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Before taking over, Hill has outlined his pro-crypto policy thoughts and criticized the FDIC's current approach to regulating digital assets. He believes that the agency's piecemeal approach to supervising cryptocurrency in the banking system has stifled innovation and driven banks away from exploring crypto-related business lines. Hill advocates for clear and transparent guidelines on what activities are legally permissible, along with timely regulatory approvals. He also criticizes the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, citing a goal to increase financial inclusion by serving unbanked individuals.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is often used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware groups. This is not a new opinion for Dimon, as he has been a long-time opponent of Bitcoin. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase has profited from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product and offers services such as being an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, the bank is rebranding its blockchain platform to focus on tokenizing real-world assets and introducing on-chain foreign exchange capabilities. This comes ahead of Donald Trump's expected friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.
