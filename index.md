Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. BTC's price initially fell due to expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, but then rebounded strongly, closing above $94,000. The article suggests that this price action, specifically a "long-legged Doji candle," is a potential signal of a bottom, similar to what happened in December when prices stalled at record highs.

The author notes that while Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is needed before traders can consider buying again. This means waiting for BTC to decisively move above the day's high of $95,900. The bears' target is now the previous low near $89,000.

The article also highlights that corporate demand for BTC has outpaced new supply this year, indicating a bullish demand-supply dynamic. Additionally, traders are awaiting the US CPI report on January 15th, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations and impact Bitcoin's price volatility. Overall, market watchers are focused on signs of stability to determine whether there will be further downside or upside in BTC's price.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to write regulations for determining whether crypto assets are securities or not. The order came in response to a petition filed by Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, which had requested that the SEC provide legal clarity on this issue. The court ruled that instead of forcing the agency to make a rule, it would order the SEC to explain its decision not to write one. This is seen as a major setback for the SEC and could leave an opening for new leadership to change the agency's course on crypto oversight.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Travis Hill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is set to take over as acting chairman when current Chairman Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19. Before taking the reins, Hill has outlined his thoughts on pro-crypto policies, calling for the FDIC to issue new guidance on digital assets and adopt a more transparent approach to regulating cryptocurrency-related activities.

Hill criticized the agency's current approach, which he believes has stifled innovation and contributed to a perception that the FDIC is "closed for business" when it comes to blockchain and distributed ledger technology. He argued that a one-by-one approach to directing banks' cryptocurrency ties has led to regulatory approvals being delayed or denied, pushing many banks away from digital assets.

Hill also expressed concern about the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable. He emphasized the need for regulators to work towards ending this practice and ensuring that the FDIC promotes access to financial services for all individuals.

As Vice Chairman, Hill will temporarily take over as acting chairman until a new permanent chairman is appointed by President-elect Donald Trump. His pro-crypto stance suggests that he may prioritize policies that support innovation and accessibility in the financial sector.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin, unlike BlackRock's Larry Fink who previously opposed Bitcoin but later reversed his stance. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase has profited from the growing use of Bitcoin as a financial product and has rebranded its blockchain platform to focus on real-world tokenization. The bank plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities in 2025. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's return to the presidency, which is expected to bring a friendlier regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has increased its bitcoin holdings for the tenth consecutive week. In the latest purchase, the company bought 2,530 BTC worth $243 million, bringing its total holdings to 450,000 BTC. The average price per bitcoin was $95,972. Saylor also used his platform at the ICR Conference in Orlando to recommend investing in bitcoin over bonds, calling bonds "toxic" due to their decline since 2020 while bitcoin has increased significantly. Meanwhile, Semler Scientific, another company with ties to MicroStrategy's CEO, acquired an additional 237 BTC worth $23.3 million, bringing its total holdings to 2,321 BTC. Both companies' shares were down slightly in premarket trading following the announcements.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin (BTC) mining ecosystem. The mining difficulty adjustment has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than when Bitcoin was first launched. This marks the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as they try to mine blocks and receive bitcoin rewards.

The article notes that this is not the first time we've seen such a trend. In the summer of 2021, there were nine consecutive positive adjustments following the China mining ban, which was followed by a bear market in 2022. Conversely, from December 2017 to Q4 2018, there were 17 positive adjustments before a decline in prices.

While there is no clear trend that emerges when Bitcoin sees many positive consecutive adjustments, it has historically indicated near cycle tops and bottoms. The article concludes that the continued strength of the hashrate (the total processing power of the network) at 775 EH/s suggests that we may reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving.

Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced by miners as the mining difficulty continues to rise, and notes that some publicly traded miners have pivoted into other industries such as high-performance computing and artificial intelligence.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of a strong US jobs report on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). After the report showed an unexpected increase in job additions and a decline in the unemployment rate, major investment banks reassessed their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. As a result:

* Bitcoin's price dropped 1.6% to below $93,000
* Other cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also fell by 3%
* The S&P 500 futures index dropped 0.3%, indicating an extension of Friday's decline
* The US dollar index (DXY) neared 110 for the first time since late 2022

The strong jobs report led some banks to push back their expected rate cuts, with Goldman Sachs now expecting only two rate cuts in 2025, and another in 2026. Bank of America, on the other hand, fears an extended pause or even a rate hike.

The article also notes that the market is waiting for next week's consumer price index (CPI) report to see if it confirms the hawkish Fed narrative. If core inflation comes in higher than expected, it could add to the risk of an extended pause or even a rate hike from the Fed.

-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of financial services giant Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 12 crypto ETFs may be launched in the US if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with potential products including a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, a combined bitcoin/ether ETF, and ETFs based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. Laser Digital predicts that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and the resolution of ongoing lawsuits against crypto companies may contribute to the approval of these new ETFs. Additionally, the ETF market is expected to continue growing in terms of assets under management (AUM), with wider adoption by institutional investors anticipated in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Singapore Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. This comes after similar actions taken by authorities in Taiwan and France. Users attempting to access the site are warned that it is an "illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider" and may face fines or jail sentences. Singapore has not made a public announcement on the issue, but local law enforcement has been notified. This development adds to the growing list of jurisdictions taking action against Polymarket, which has also faced scrutiny from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission over alleged illegal activities related to its platform.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is expected to experience increased volatility this week due to the upcoming token unlock schedule. The unlocks, which release frozen tokens onto the market, are worth a total of $3 billion - the largest amount since November. Ondo Finance's ONDO token accounts for a significant portion of this total, with 1.94 billion ONDO tokens worth $2.23 billion set to be released on January 18th. This is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply and several times its daily trading volume. While unlocks are designed to prevent rapid price swings and market instability, large releases like this one can still inject volatility into the market. The ONDO token has already experienced a significant decline in value since hitting record highs in December, losing nearly 15% of its value in the past month.
