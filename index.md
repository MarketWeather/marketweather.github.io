Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 09:57 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The value of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 1.6% to below $93,000 due to changes in expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts following a strong jobs report on Friday. The report showed an increase of 256,000 nonfarm payrolls, surpassing expectations, which led major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs to reassess their predictions.

Goldman Sachs has pushed back its expected interest rate cut from March to June, while Bank of America (BofA) expects the Fed to pause or even raise rates. JPMorgan still expects rate cuts, but at a slower pace. The changes in expectations have led to a drop in cryptocurrency prices, with major coins like XRP, ADA, and DOGE posting losses.

The article also mentions that traditional markets are affected, with futures tied to the S&P 500 trading lower, and the dollar index (DXY) nearing its highest level since late 2022. The Treasury yields have also risen, supporting further gains in the dollar.

Overall, the strong jobs report has shifted the focus from rate cuts to a potential pause or hike by the Fed, which is affecting the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

Date : 08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report from Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 12 crypto ETFs could launch in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These potential products include ETFs tracking the S&P 500's return in Bitcoin, combined Bitcoin/Ether/Litecoin/XRP/Solana ETFs, and more. Laser Digital suggests that a Bitcoin/Ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report also notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC chairman Paul Atkins and the exit of Gary Gensler may lead to an increase in approvals for new ETFs. Additionally, Grayscale has filed to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF. Overall, the report expects the ETF market to continue growing and sees wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

Date : 08:16 13 Jan 2025

The article reports that Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. Users attempting to access the site are warned that it is an "illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider" and that those found guilty of using it can face fines or imprisonment. This follows similar actions taken by authorities in Taiwan, France, and the US, which have blocked users from accessing Polymarket or investigated its use. The platform has been criticized for allowing betting on election outcomes, among other issues.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the upcoming token unlock schedule for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which is expected to release billions of dollars worth of supply into the market. The largest unlock event is scheduled for Ondo Finance's ONDO token, with 1.94 billion tokens (worth $2.23 billion) being released on January 18. This is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply and significantly exceeds its daily trading volume. While unlocks are designed to prevent rapid price swings and market instability, larger events like this can still inject volatility into the market. The article notes that tokens facing unlocks equivalent to 100% of their average daily volume experience volatility in the lead-up to and following the event. As a result, ONDO's prices have been falling sharply since hitting record highs in December, with a current price of $1.14 representing a nearly 15% decline in just one month.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to divest several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest if confirmed. According to his ethics agreement and financial disclosures, Bessent has over $700 million in assets, including a $250,000 to $500,000 investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Other investments that could pose conflicts include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent would face the challenge of managing the federal debt while implementing Trump's tax reform and deregulation plans.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 22:26 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol faced backlash from its community after introducing a new feature that allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a lower price than expected. The change in the redemption mechanism, called "dual-path exit," triggered a sell-off on secondary markets, causing the value of USD0++ token to fall below 90 cents from $1. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, also plummeted by 17% before recovering some losses.

The issue arose because investors were caught off guard by the change, which was introduced without warning. The new feature allowed for early redemption at a price of USD0++ tokens that was lower than the initial expectation of $1. This led to criticism from DeFi users and liquidity providers who felt that the design change was not transparent or communicated effectively.

The Usual Protocol team apologized for the misunderstanding and emphasized that the change was communicated in advance, starting in October. However, investors were still caught off guard by the sudden implementation of the new feature.

The episode serves as a reminder of the potential risks involved with DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. It highlights the importance of clear communication and transparency to avoid market panic and maintain trust among users.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving the agency after just 11 months on the job. During his tenure, he oversaw high-profile cases involving cryptocurrency, including lawsuits against Binance and FTX, which resulted in significant recoveries for victims. McGinley highlighted the CFTC's focus on digital assets in a 2023 speech, stating that the agency has "risen to the challenge" in this area.

McGinley's departure creates an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a new chair takes over. The current Republican commissioners, Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger, are potential candidates for the chairmanship, along with former Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who is now Head of Policy at a16z crypto.

The CFTC has traditionally taken a backseat to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in terms of cryptocurrency enforcement. However, if crypto legislation advances in 2025, the CFTC could become the dominant agency overseeing U.S. digital assets markets.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal seeks to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to the value of a steady asset, such as the US dollar. This would require stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers to follow consumer protection regulations, including making disclosures and providing protections against unauthorized transactions.

The proposal is at an early stage, and its fate is uncertain given the upcoming arrival of President-elect Donald Trump, who will have the power to appoint a new CFPB chief. The current director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily, but Trump can fire him or replace him with someone else.

The proposed regulations would treat stablecoins as a payment mechanism and apply consumer protections to them, including requiring institutions that provide virtual currency wallets to make disclosures and provide protections against unauthorized transactions. This could impact decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which often operate without outside interference or use self-hosted wallet technology.

Some advocates, such as Better Markets, support the proposal, arguing it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, others, including the Cato Institute's Jack Solowey, have criticized the proposal, saying it doesn't adequately address decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The proposed regulations are currently open for public comment, but their future is uncertain given the incoming Trump administration and the possibility that a Republican-led Congress could erase them using the Congressional Review Act.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is shifting its stance on cryptocurrencies and preparing legislation to legalize them. This marks a change from previous warnings against the industry. The country's Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, emphasized the need for a regulatory framework to capitalize on the potential benefits of the industry while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers in December, aiming to establish a fair and competitive market for cryptocurrency players. This move is a significant change from the country's previous stance, which warned against using cryptocurrencies in 2015. The government hopes to foster innovation and financial literacy through this new approach.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 17:25 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov (who is at-large), have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges relate to their operation of two crypto mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io, which were used to launder criminal proceeds, including those from North Korean hackers. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of cryptocurrency proceeds from cyber thefts. The authorities have already seized and dismantled the computer equipment behind the services. The prosecution of crypto mixing services has been a point of contention among US policymakers and members of Congress, with some arguing that these services facilitate criminal activity while others see them as champions of financial privacy.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between Bitcoin and the Cosmos network. This bridge aims to enhance Bitcoin's interoperability by allowing transactions to be made across different blockchains. The project utilizes BitVM2, a computing paradigm that enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, paving the way for zero-knowledge technology. Zero-knowledge computations enable parties to verify information without revealing what it is.

The goal of this initiative is to unlock the value stored in BTC and allow it to be transacted on other blockchains that may not have the same limitations as Bitcoin. This is part of a broader movement to extract greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to what happens on networks like Ethereum.

Babylon's staking protocol has already gained significant traction, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion. The introduction of BitVM2's predecessor was hailed as a breakthrough for making Bitcoin more programmable, and now developers are building bridges between Bitcoin and other networks using this technology.

One example is Citrea, a zero-knowledge rollup backed by Galaxy Digital, which deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet. This bridge aims to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling smart contracts execution on both platforms.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 16:21 10 Jan 2025

Crypto exchange Bybit is temporarily suspending its services in India due to regulatory requirements. As of Sunday, Indian users will not be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. The company is working to register as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider under Indian law and expects to complete the process within weeks. Bybit wants to resume full service once registration is completed. This move comes after India mandated that crypto companies must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with anti-money laundering regulations in March 2023.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 13:39 10 Jan 2025

The US employment market showed strong growth in December, exceeding economists' forecasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 256,000 jobs last month, beating predictions of 160,000 and up from 212,000 in November. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.1% in December, down from 4.2% in November.

The job market report came after a series of recent economic reports that triggered a broad-market pullback across asset classes, including a decline in crypto markets such as bitcoin. Bitcoin fell over 2% immediately following the report, dropping from nearly $103,000 to around $92,800.

Traditional markets also reacted negatively to the jobs report, with US stock index futures down about 1%. The bond market saw a significant increase, with the 10-year Treasury yield jumping nine basis points higher to 4.78%. The dollar index surged 0.6%, and gold prices moved modestly lower.

The strong job market data has led traders to scale back bets on further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. The odds of a March rate cut have fallen to 28% from 41% ahead of the report, while the odds of a May rate cut have declined to 34% from 44%. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December and were higher by 3.9% year-over-year, beating forecasts.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

Date : 13:32 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent trend in the crypto market, specifically focusing on three alternative cryptocurrencies: XRP, DOGE, and XLM. According to data from TradingView, the prices of these tokens have recovered on both Coinbase (a proxy for US demand) and Binance (an offshore exchange). The Coinbase premium indicator, which measures the spread between prices on Coinbase and Binance, shows a surge in early December due to Bitcoin's rise above $108,000. However, as Bitcoin's uptrend slowed down in the second half of the month, the premium turned into a discount. This indicates that stateside investors are re-entering the market, driving up prices again.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 12:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, has released a new music video despite facing a prison sentence for laundering cryptocurrency stolen from Bitfinex. Morgan's husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft, which resulted in nearly 120,000 bitcoins being stolen. Morgan was sentenced to 18 months in prison and will have to report by the end of January. The music video, "Razzlekhan vs. The United States," is a tongue-in-cheek commentary that Morgan claims is meant to inspire others who are misunderstood or judged. In the song, she raps about her experiences and thoughts on her federal case, as well as her frustration with being publicly shamed for her actions. The video features Morgan dressed in red ropes and posing aggressively into the camera, a stark contrast from her conservative attire during her court appearance where she apologized for her role in concealing and cashing out parts of the stolen fortune.

Bitcoin Registers 14 Green Hourly Candles, Longest Streak Since 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 11:30 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses a unusual price action in the Bitcoin market, specifically with regards to its chart on Coinbase. For 14 hours straight, from January 9th at 21:00 UTC to January 10th at 10:00 UTC, the hourly candlesticks have been green, indicating gains for each hour. This is the longest streak of green candles since at least January 1st, 2017. The trend has left traders perplexed and wondering what caused it. Analyst Vetle Lunde from K33 Research looked into the data and found similar patterns in recent times, including instances on January 14th, 2023, February 26th, 2024, and November 12th, 2024. The current trend appears to have ended with a red candlestick at 12:00 UTC.

Sentiment Readings Favor Dogecoin Gains as Cardano’s ADA Leads Market Bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 10:47 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of various cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana's SOL, and others. It highlights that Dogecoin has been quiet recently, shedding 28% of its market cap over the past month, but with a sentiment score currently at low levels of 1 out of 5, indicating potential for upside. Large investors, or "whales," are showing increased interest in DOGE, with transactions over $100,000 spiking, hinting at short-term price bumps.

The article also notes that:

* January has been Dogecoin's best-performing month historically, averaging an 85% return.
* Technical indicators suggest a bullish trend for DOGE, with a short-term target at 50 cents (a more than 30% bump from its current level).
* Bitcoin is neutral after a dip and recovery, ranging between $90,000 and $100,000 levels.
* Ether sees bearish sentiment despite prices holding above $3,000.
* XRP is bullish after an 18% rise in the past week.
* Solana remains semi-bullish, with a loyal community buying dips.
* Cardano's ADA led a market-wide recovery in Asian afternoon hours on Friday with a 5.5% move.

The article concludes that current levels could prove ripe for risk-on traders, particularly for Dogecoin, as sentiment and indicators suggest potential upside.

EU's MiCA Rules Will Likely Boost Euro Denominated Stablecoins, JPMorgan Says
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 10:35 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of the EU's MiCA regulations on stablecoins. The new rules, which came into effect on December 30, require stablecoin issuers to maintain significant reserves in European banks and obtain licenses for trading. As a result:

* Compliant stablecoins, such as Circle's EURC, are gaining strength.
* Non-compliant stablecoins, like Tether's EURT, are facing challenges and have been discontinued or delisted from many EU-based exchanges.
* Tether has phased out its euro stablecoin (EURT) and is focusing on maintaining a presence in Asian markets where restrictions are less stringent.

However, the article notes that Tether remains a dominant force in the global stablecoin market and has invested in MiCA-compliant stablecoin issuers, such as Quantoz Payments and StablR. This indicates its commitment to remaining active in the EU market.

Bitcoin Data Indicates Ripe Buying Period as BTC Nears $95K
-----------------------------------------------------------

Date : 10:29 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin market and suggests that buying at current price levels could be a good opportunity for investors. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has risen to 0.987, indicating that investors who have held Bitcoin for less than six months are selling at a loss, which is often a sign that prices will recover. Additionally, other indicators such as the Market Value to Realized Value and the Puell Multiple suggest that the market has not reached its peak and that a further decline could present better opportunities for accumulation.

The article also notes that recent economic data has caused a slump in the Bitcoin price, with the cryptocurrency falling 10% from its weekly high. The ISM report showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US service sector, which could lead to interest rate hikes and be negative for risk assets like Bitcoin.

Overall, the article suggests that buying at current price levels could be a good opportunity for investors, as short-term investors may experience more pain, presenting better opportunities for accumulation. The author of the article quotes a contributing analyst from CryptoQuant, MAC\_D, who says that selling coins at this juncture might prove to be a very unwise decision.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Briefly Went Negative, Usually Marks a Local Bottom: Van Straten
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 10:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent volatility in Bitcoin's (BTC) price, which has been swinging between $90,000 and $100,000 since November 18th. The author notes that when BTC approaches $100,000, investors tend to become bullish, while approaching $90,000 leads to bearish sentiment.

The article highlights the role of derivatives, such as futures and options, in influencing the price swings. One key metric is the perpetual funding rate, which measures the average rate set by exchanges for perpetual futures contracts. A positive rate indicates that long positions are paying short positions, while a negative rate suggests the opposite.

As of Thursday, the funding rate briefly went into negative territory (-0.001%), marking its first occurrence this year and only the second time since November. This led to a "leverage flush" and a shift in sentiment before BTC returned above $94,000.

The article notes that negative funding rates can signal a possible price rebound or bottom, but also caution that they don't always lead to immediate price movements. The author suggests that positive funding rates during a bull market may not necessarily mean the market is overheated, while brief periods of negative rates during a bear market could indicate a continued downturn.

The article concludes by stating that when the funding rate goes negative, it often signals the emergence of a floor in the market, as bears become overconfident and get liquidated. Similarly, when bulls become complacent, the spot price can no longer keep up with the leverage used, leading to a correction.
