Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin market, which has been experiencing a consolidation period between $90,000 and $100,000. This volatility is causing investor sentiment to swing from fear to greed. According to Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, this correction is normal for a volatile asset like Bitcoin, with a 15% decline from its highs being typical. Lee notes that previous bull market drawdowns were much larger, around 30%-50%, indicating that Bitcoin is becoming more mature. He believes that $70,000 is a strong support level and that if it doesn't hold, the price could potentially test the $50,000 level. Despite this short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's prospects for 2025, predicting end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved Bitcoin ETF option, IBIT, has experienced significant demand since its launch on November 19. As of Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion. This is almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, which has a notional value of $23 billion. The growth in demand for IBIT options is attributed to its regulated status, making it attractive to US-based investors who prefer regulated markets. This has led to increased competition with Deribit, which has historically been the leading platform for crypto options trading. However, Deribit's CEO, Luuk Strijers, sees the growth in IBIT options as a positive development, citing new arbitrage opportunities and enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants. The demand is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a preference for lower-priced options.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of Bitcoin's (BTC) price, which has been experiencing a recovery after dipping below a key support zone. The price initially fell due to investment banks scaling back expectations for Fed rate cuts and potential rate hikes following a strong jobs report. However, the dip was short-lived, and by the end of the day, BTC surged back to $94,000, leaving behind a "long-legged Doji candle" pattern that is often seen as a sign of downtrend exhaustion and potentially indicating a bottom.

The article notes that while Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is required in the form of a decisive move above the day's high. The bears are now focused on beating the level of $89,000, which was the low point reached on Monday.

Additionally, the article highlights that BTC's demand-supply dynamics continue to lean bullishly, with corporate demand for BTC outpacing new coin supply this year. Price volatility may pick up again due to the upcoming U.S. CPI report on January 15, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations.

Overall, market watchers are now focused on signs of stability to see further downside or upside in the price of Bitcoin and other major altcoins.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to write regulations for determining whether crypto assets are securities or not. This follows Coinbase's formal request for the agency to provide clarity on how it assesses whether certain digital assets are securities. The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit partially sided with Coinbase, stating that the SEC must explain its decision rather than forcing the agency to make a rule. The judges criticized the SEC's previous explanations as "conclusory and insufficiently reasoned," calling their actions "arbitrary and capricious." This ruling could potentially open up an opportunity for new leadership at the SEC to change its approach on crypto oversight, particularly with Chair Gary Gensler stepping down soon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is expected to take over as chairman on an interim basis soon. Before that, he shared his thoughts on pro-crypto policies for the agency. Hill believes the FDIC should issue new guidance for digital assets and move away from its current piecemeal approach, which has stifled innovation and led to a perception that the agency is closed to crypto-related businesses. He also criticized the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to debank law-abiding customers are unacceptable. Hill wants regulators to clearly describe what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them safely and soundly.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it "has no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware attackers. This is consistent with his previous stance on the cryptocurrency. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase has profited from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, including serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF. The bank has also rebranded its blockchain platform to Kinexys, aiming to reduce limitations of the current financial infrastructure through real-world tokenization. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's reassumption of the U.S. presidency, with Trump and his team promising a friendlier regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto in general.
