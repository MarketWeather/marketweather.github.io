Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty adjustment, which has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion. This represents a significant increase in the difficulty of mining a block and puts pressure on miners to continue their operations. The difficulty adjustment adjusts every 2,016 blocks and recalibrates to ensure that blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes.

The article notes that this is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which has not been seen before. In the past, such a trend has indicated near cycle tops or bottoms, but there is no clear trend that emerges from these consecutive adjustments.

The mining difficulty increase is also affecting publicly traded miners, who are struggling to survive on bitcoin rewards alone and are pivoting into other industries such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). Some miners have even issued convertible bonds to buy bitcoin or optimize revenue by lending out their bitcoin at single-digit yields.

The article also mentions MARA Holdings' decision to issue convertible bonds to buy bitcoin, indicating the company's willingness to diversify its revenue streams.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of a strong jobs report in the US on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Despite reaching new highs in recent weeks, BTC began the week with a 1.6% decline, dipping below $93,000. This drop is attributed to major investment banks reassessing their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts following the strong jobs report.

The report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate, leading some banks to push out their expected rate cut timelines. Goldman Sachs, for example, now expects only two rate cuts in 2025, while Bank of America warns that the Fed may actually hike interest rates or tighten monetary policy.

The article also notes that Treasury yields have surged since the last rate cut, and the dollar index has reached levels not seen since late 2022. The S&P 500 futures are down 0.3%, indicating a continuation of Friday's decline. Overall, the strong jobs report has shifted expectations for Fed rate cuts, leading to a negative reaction in the cryptocurrency market.

Key points:

* Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $93,000, representing a 1.6% drop
* Strong jobs report led investment banks to reassess expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts
* Goldman Sachs expects only two rate cuts in 2025, while Bank of America warns of potential rate hike or tightening
* Treasury yields have surged since the last rate cut, and the dollar index has reached levels not seen since late 2022

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, the digital asset subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company predicts that over 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These products include a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, combined bitcoin/ether ETFs, and ETFs based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The report suggests that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. With the appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as SEC chairman and the potential for ongoing lawsuits against crypto companies to fade away, the approval of these new ETFs seems more likely. The ETF market is expected to continue growing in terms of assets under management (AUM) and will see wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025, particularly with President-elect Donald Trump back in office supported by a team of crypto-friendly regulators.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered internet service providers in the country to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. The GRA issued a warning message to users who tried to access the site, stating that accessing an unlicensed gambling website can result in fines up to SGD 10,000 or imprisonment for up to 6 months. This follows similar actions by authorities in Taiwan, France, and the US, which have all taken steps to restrict or block Polymarket due to concerns over its legality. The platform has been banned in Taiwan since it allowed betting on local elections, while the French gaming authority has also blocked access to the site. Additionally, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase as part of an investigation into Polymarket's activities involving US nationals.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the upcoming release of billions of dollars worth of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) this week, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. According to Tokenomist, a total of $3 billion in altcoins will be unlocked, with ONDO accounting for a large share of that amount. Specifically, on January 18th, 1.94 billion ONDO tokens worth $2.23 billion will be released, which is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply. This release is several times larger than ONDO's daily trading volume, which has recently been around $250-300 million. The article notes that while unlocks are intended to prevent rapid price swings and market instability, large releases like this one can still inject volatility into the market. As a result, prices of affected coins may experience increased volatility in the lead-up to and following the event.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, has filed ethics agreements and financial disclosures worth over $700 million. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, Bessent plans to dispose of several assets, including his investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) worth $250,000 to $500,000. Other investments that may pose a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in a conservative publisher. If confirmed, Bessent would be responsible for managing the federal debt amid Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol and its recent issues with community backlash. The protocol, which allows users to stake their funds and earn rewards in the form of USD0++ tokens, introduced a new feature called "dual-path exit" that allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price. This change was not communicated well to the community, leading to confusion and a sell-off on secondary markets.

As a result, the price of USD0++ tokens fell briefly below $1 on Curve, a decentralized marketplace, while the protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17%. The selloff caused by this change in redemption mechanism led to market panic, with some investors questioning whether the protocol was allowing "degenerative" behavior (i.e., taking advantage of unsuspecting users) and wondering if the $1 peg on USD0++ was being compromised.

The Usual Protocol team apologized for any confusion caused and emphasized that they had communicated the change in advance. However, DeFi experts have pointed out that this episode highlights the potential risks of DeFi products that offer high-yield token incentives and rewards flywheels, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication and clear rules to avoid market panic.

The total value locked (TVL) in the Usual Protocol, a key DeFi metric, has dropped below $1.6 billion as a result of this episode, but USD0++ tokens have recovered slightly to trade at around 0.91 USD0 on Curve.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position after a relatively short tenure. During his time at the agency, he oversaw several high-profile cases related to cryptocurrencies, including lawsuits against Binance and FTX. He also played a key role in the CFTC's special focus on digital assets, which he described as a "remarkable" effort. McGinley's departure opens up an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. Sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger are being considered as potential candidates for the role, alongside former Commissioner Brian Quintenz. The CFTC's next steps will depend on whether crypto legislation advances in 2025, which could see the agency take on an even more prominent role in overseeing US digital assets markets.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations for stablecoin issuers and wallet providers, which could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. The proposal would apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, requiring institutions that provide these services to make consumer disclosures and provide protections against unauthorized transactions. This could impact decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that operate without outside interference.

The CFPB's proposal defines "funds" as including not only stablecoins but also other volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, if they are used as a payment mechanism or medium of exchange. Additionally, the regulation would require institutions to provide protections against unauthorized transactions and allow consumers to cancel improper transfers.

While the proposal is currently open for public comment, its future is uncertain given that Donald Trump is about to take office and has the power to appoint a new CFPB chief. The Supreme Court has confirmed that the president can fire and replace the director at will. Even if the regulation is finalized, it could be erased by Congress using its Congressional Review Act authority.

Industry experts have mixed opinions on the proposal. Consumer advocacy group Better Markets applauds the move, saying it would level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, some critics argue that the CFPB's arguments are "embarrassingly conclusory" and do not address decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets. The future of this regulation remains uncertain in the wake of Trump's inauguration.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a regulatory framework to oversee the industry. According to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, the country aims to capitalize on the benefits of virtual assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya had previously warned against cryptocurrency use in 2015, stating that they were not legal tender and no entity was licensed to offer crypto-based money remittance services. However, the industry has grown in popularity, with around 8.5% of Kenyans owning cryptocurrencies. The government is working on a draft policy to establish a "fair, competitive, and stable market" for cryptocurrency players and foster innovation and financial literacy. This shift marks a significant change from Kenya's previous stance against cryptocurrencies.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov (who is still at large), have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges stem from their operation of two sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding North Korean hackers in concealing the proceeds of cyber thefts. According to the indictment, the defendants ran "safe havens" for laundering criminal funds, including those obtained through ransomware and wire fraud. The US Department of Justice alleges that these services made it easier for state-sponsored hacking groups and other cybercriminals to profit from illegal activities that threatened public safety and national security.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between Bitcoin and the Cosmos network. This bridge will enable interoperability between the two networks, allowing for the transfer of Bitcoin assets to other blockchains without compromising security. The project uses BitVM2, a computing paradigm that enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin. This technology allows for zero-knowledge computations, which verify information accuracy without revealing sensitive details.

The goal is to unlock the value stored in BTC and use it to finance other ecosystems, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. Babylon Labs' staking protocol has a total value locked of around $5.5 billion.

The introduction of BitVM2 was hailed as a breakthrough for making Bitcoin more programmable, enabling rollups that handle fast and cheap transactions without compromising security. This technology inspired many developers building projects on Bitcoin, including those focused on bridging to other networks.

A zero-knowledge rollup called Citrea, backed by Galaxy Digital, has already deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet, which is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The project aims to enhance the interoperability of Bitcoin and other blockchains.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

16:21 10 Jan 2025

Crypto exchange Bybit has announced it will temporarily suspend its services in India due to regulatory requirements. From Sunday, Indian users will no longer be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. The company is working to register as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and expects to complete the process within weeks. This move comes after India mandated registration with the FIU in March 2023 and enforcement of anti-money laundering measures under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Bybit is committed to resuming full service once registered.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

13:39 10 Jan 2025

The US employment market saw significant growth in December, surpassing economist forecasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 256,000 jobs last month, up from 212,000 in November. This strong job growth led to a unexpected decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December.

The market reaction was swift and significant, with:

* Bitcoin falling over 2% to $92,800
* Major altcoins experiencing larger declines
* US stock index futures down roughly 1%
* The 10-year Treasury yield rising 9 basis points to 4.78%
* The dollar index surging 0.6%
* Gold moving modestly lower to just below $2,700 per ounce

Traders are scaling back bets on further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025, with the odds of a March move declining to 28% and the odds of a May rate cut falling to 34%. Average hourly earnings also saw a slight increase, rising 0.3% in December compared to forecasts.

Overall, the strong job growth data has led to a shift in market expectations, away from further rate cuts and towards potential interest rate hikes in the future.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

13:32 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price trends of three major alternative cryptocurrencies: XRP, DOGE, and XLM. According to TradingView data, these tokens have seen a notable recovery on both Coinbase (a proxy for US demand) and Binance (an offshore exchange). The "Coinbase premium indicator" measures the spread between prices on Coinbase and Binance, with tether (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar) used as a reference. This metric surged in early December as Bitcoin's price reached new highs, but then quickly turned into a discount by the end of the month due to hawkish Federal Reserve expectations tempering the market's enthusiasm for altcoins. The recent rebound in prices suggests renewed participation from US investors in these markets.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, has released a new music video just days before she is set to begin serving an 18-month prison sentence for laundering stolen cryptocurrency from Bitfinex. Morgan's husband was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft of almost 120,000 bitcoin, worth around $11 billion today. The couple's crimes were featured in a Netflix documentary called "Biggest Heist Ever". In the music video, Morgan's rapper alter ego Razzlekhan is dressed in red ropes and appears to be bound, rapping about feeling trapped and misunderstood. Morgan has said that her performances are meant as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on her experiences and that they have inspired others who feel like outsiders. Despite her request to be released from prison early, the judge ruled that she must serve out her sentence, although she will not have to report until the end of January.
