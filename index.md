MicroStrategy Added 2,530 Bitcoin for $243M, Bringing Holdings to 450K BTC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

MicroStrategy, a company led by CEO Michael Saylor, has purchased an additional 2,530 Bitcoins (BTC) worth $243 million, bringing their total holdings to 450,000 BTC. This marks the tenth consecutive week that MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings. The average price paid for the latest purchase was $95,972, with an overall average purchase price of $62,691. Saylor announced the news on Twitter and shares in MicroStrategy dropped by nearly 5% in premarket trading, while the price of Bitcoin also fell by a similar amount to around $90,000.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses recent records in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining ecosystem. Specifically:

* The mining difficulty adjustment has reached a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block.
* This marks the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners to maintain their operations.
* Some publicly traded miners have had to pivot into other industries, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), due to the increased difficulty and decreased profitability from mining alone.

The article also notes that this is not the first time we've seen a streak of consecutive positive adjustments. In 2021, after the China mining ban, there were nine consecutive positive adjustments, which coincided with the bull market top when Bitcoin reached $69,000. Conversely, in 2018, there were 17 consecutive positive adjustments before the price declined and reached its bottom at around $3,000.

The article concludes that while it's difficult to determine a clear trend from these records, they have historically indicated near-cycle tops and bottoms in the past. Additionally, the continued strength of the hashrate (measured in exahashes per second) suggests that we may reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin's value has taken a hit due to changes in expectations about Federal Reserve rate cuts. The strong US jobs report released on Friday led investment banks to reassess their predictions for rate cuts, causing a decline in Bitcoin's price by 1.6% to below $93,000. Other cryptocurrencies also saw significant losses, with the CoinDesk 20 Index down over 3%. In traditional markets, the S&P 500 futures were trading 0.3% lower and the dollar index was nearing its highest level since late 2022.

The jobs report showed a larger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate, leading some to believe that the Fed may not cut rates as much as previously expected. Goldman Sachs, for example, has pushed out its prediction of the next interest rate cut from March to June. Other banks, such as Bank of America and ING, are warning that there is a risk of an extended pause in rate cuts or even a rate hike.

The article suggests that the recent economic reports have shifted the focus away from rate cuts and towards the possibility of higher interest rates, which could be bad news for Bitcoin's price. The December consumer price index report is scheduled to be released next week, and if it shows strong inflation growth, it could further cement a hawkish Fed narrative and put downward pressure on Bitcoin's value.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Over a dozen crypto ETFs have been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval, with potential products including a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, a combined bitcoin/ether ETF, and others based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC, following the exit of Gary Gensler, may lead to increased approval of new ETFs. Additionally, Grayscale has filed to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into an ETF. Laser Digital predicts that the ETF market will continue to grow and see wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025, with President-elect Donald Trump's return to office potentially supporting a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The article reports that Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. This is similar to actions taken by Taiwan and France against the platform. In Singapore, users who attempt to access the site will be warned that it is an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed provider, and those found guilty could face fines of up to SGD 10,000 or a six-month jail sentence. The GRA has not made a public announcement about the blocking, but local law enforcement has taken action against users who have bet on Polymarket. Additionally, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating Polymarket's activities in the United States and has subpoenaed Coinbase for information about users trading on the platform.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is expected to see increased volatility this week due to the impending token unlock schedule. The unlocks will release billions of dollars worth of supply for several coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token, which accounts for a significant portion of the total amount. Specifically, ONDO's upcoming unlock on January 18 will free up 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion, which is equivalent to over 130% of its circulating supply. This large unlock has the potential to inject volatility into the market, as it is several times bigger than ONDO's daily trading volume. Historically, unlocks that are equivalent to 100% of a token's average daily volume have experienced volatility in the lead-up to and following the event. As a result, investors may want to be cautious when trading altcoins this week.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, has filed financial disclosures revealing assets worth over $700 million. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, Bessent plans to dispose of certain assets, including a $250,000-$500,000 investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Other investments posing a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and stakes in conservative publisher All Seasons and China's currency trading account. If confirmed, Bessent will face the challenge of managing the federal debt amidst Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced a sell-off on Friday after introducing a change to its yield-generating token, USD0++. The change allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, which caught users off guard and caused market panic.

The protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted by as much as 17% before recovering some of the losses. The USD0++ token fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve, a decentralized marketplace.

The issue arose because investors had locked up their funds in exchange for rewards earned in USD0 and USUAL tokens, with no expectation that they could redeem their locked-up tokens early. The change raised concerns about the protocol's design and communication with users.

The Usual team apologized for any misunderstanding and said that the change was communicated in advance from October. However, some DeFi users felt that the change was made without sufficient warning or transparency.

The episode serves as a lesson for crypto investors to be aware of the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. It also highlights the importance of clear communication and transparent information to prevent market panic.

As a result, USD0++ traded at 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool, and the protocol's total value locked dropped below $1.6 billion.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position after a relatively short tenure. During his time at the agency, he oversaw several high-profile cases involving cryptocurrency, including lawsuits against Binance and the conclusion of enforcement actions against FTX. McGinley highlighted the CFTC's focus on digital assets in a 2023 speech, saying that the agency had "risen to the challenge" in an impressive way. His departure creates an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement efforts when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. Sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger are potential candidates for the chairmanship, along with former Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who is currently Head of Policy at a16z crypto. The CFTC's departure could also pave the way for the agency to become more prominent in overseeing U.S. digital assets markets if crypto legislation gains traction in 2025.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset's value, commonly the US dollar. This could significantly affect how US stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers operate.

The proposal defines "funds" as including stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies that serve as a medium of exchange or means of paying for goods and services. It also suggests that virtual currency wallets used for retail transactions should fall under regulatory requirements, including consumer disclosures and protections against unauthorized transactions.

Consumer advocacy group Better Markets supports the proposal, saying it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, critics argue that the proposal is flawed and does not consider decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The future of this proposal is uncertain, as Trump's appointment to the CFPB chief role could lead to changes or even reversal of the regulation. Additionally, a Republican-led Congress has the authority to erase the rule using its Congressional Review Act power.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies, shifting its stance from previous warnings against the industry. The country's Treasury Cabinet Secretary, John Mbadi, emphasized the need for a regulatory framework to capitalize on the benefits of the industry while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers in December, aiming to establish a fair market and foster innovation and financial literacy. This marks a significant change from 2015 when the country's central bank issued a warning against cryptocurrency use. With around 8.5% of Kenyans now owning cryptocurrencies, lawmakers are considering taxing crypto as the industry continues to grow.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov (who is at-large), have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges relate to their operation of two sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing services: Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Blender.io was previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding North Korean hackers in concealing the proceeds of cyber thefts. The indictment alleges that the defendants operated "safe havens" for laundering criminally derived funds, including those from ransomware and wire fraud. This prosecution is part of a larger controversy surrounding crypto mixing services, which some argue represent both vulnerabilities to criminal use and champions of financial privacy.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin and Cosmos networks. This bridge will enable interoperability between the two blockchains, allowing for the transfer of value and smart contracts between them. The bridge uses BitVM2, a computing paradigm that enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin. This technology also allows for zero-knowledge computations, which verify information without revealing it. The goal is to unlock the value stored in BTC and use it to finance other ecosystems and allow transactions on blockchains with faster and cheaper transaction processing. Babylon Labs' staking protocol has a total value locked of $5.5 billion, making it one of the largest projects in this sector.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

16:21 10 Jan 2025

Crypto exchange Bybit is temporarily suspending services for its Indian users due to regulatory requirements in the country. From Sunday, Indian customers will not be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. The company is working to register as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider with India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which it expects to complete within weeks. Once registered, Bybit plans to resume full service. This move comes after India introduced rules in March 2023 requiring crypto companies to register and comply with anti-money laundering measures.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

13:39 10 Jan 2025

The US employment market showed strong growth in December, exceeding economists' forecasts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 256,000 jobs, up from 212,000 in November (revised). The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in November and below expectations. This news led to a reaction in financial markets, with:

* Bitcoin falling over 2% to $92,800
* Traditional stock index futures declining around 1%
* Bond market yields increasing by 9 basis points to 4.78%
* Dollar index rising 0.6%
* Gold prices dipping slightly to just below $2,700 per ounce

The jobs report also led to a scaling back of bets on further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025, with the odds of a March move falling to 28% and May's rate cut declining to 34%. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December, with a year-over-year increase of 3.9%, both beating forecasts. Overall, the strong job growth and rising unemployment rate have sparked a shift in market expectations.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

13:32 10 Jan 2025

The cryptocurrency market has seen a positive shift this week, with prices for XRP, DOGE, and XLM stabilizing at similar levels on both Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and Binance (an offshore exchange). This is a sign of renewed interest from US investors in these alternative cryptocurrencies. The "Coinbase premium" indicator, which measures the price difference between Coinbase and Binance, had surged earlier this month as Bitcoin's value rose to new highs. However, when Bitcoin's uptrend slowed down due to hawkish Federal Reserve expectations, the premium turned into a discount, indicating that US investors were no longer driving up prices. This week's stabilization of XRP, DOGE, and XLM prices suggests that US investors are once again participating in these markets.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, a rapper in the crypto industry, has released a new music video despite being sentenced to 18 months in prison for laundering stolen cryptocurrency from Bitfinex. Her husband, Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein, was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft of almost 120,000 bitcoin, which is now worth $11 billion.

The new song, "Razzlekhan vs. The United States", does not directly attack the investigation or court proceedings that led to her sentence. Instead, it features Morgan's provocative persona and lyrics that comment on societal issues. She claims that the performance is meant as a tongue-in-cheek commentary and has inspired many creatives and misfits.

Morgan was sentenced in December, but the judge delayed her prison start date until January 2023. As part of her sentence, she will have restricted computer use and monitoring. The case is featured in a Netflix documentary, "Biggest Heist Ever".

The latest music video appears to be a nod to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X.com, who has become a political ally of President-elect Donald Trump.

Bitcoin Registers 14 Green Hourly Candles, Longest Streak Since 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------

11:30 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses a unusual price chart for Bitcoin (BTC) on Coinbase, where the BTCUSD pair has had 14 consecutive hours of gains from January 9th at 21:00 UTC to January 10th at 10:00 UTC. This trend is the longest hourly green candle streak since at least January 1st, 2017. The article also notes that similar patterns have appeared in recent times, including on January 14th, 2023, February 26th, 2024, and November 12th, 2024. However, it's worth noting that the trend has now ended with a red hourly candle at 12:00 UTC, potentially ending this streak of gains.

Sentiment Readings Favor Dogecoin Gains as Cardano’s ADA Leads Market Bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:47 10 Jan 2025

The article suggests that Dogecoin (DOGE), a popular meme coin, may be undervalued and poised for a price increase. According to analytics firm Santiment, DOGE's crowd sentiment is at its lowest point in over a year, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Additionally, large investors ("whales") are showing increased interest in DOGE, with transactions over $100,000 spiking. The article also notes that January has historically been DOGE's best-performing month, with an average return of 85%.

Other major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL) have mixed sentiment, with some showing bullish trends while others are neutral or bearish. The article suggests that risk-on traders may find opportunities in the current market, particularly in DOGE.

It's worth noting that the article also mentions other cryptocurrencies, such as Cardano's ADA, which led a market-wide recovery on Friday, and AI-related tokens, which saw significant growth on Binance spot listings.
