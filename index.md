Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent fluctuations in Bitcoin's price, which has fallen below $90,000 but is now above $96,500, with an 8% increase. Tom Lee, a bitcoin bull and head of research at Fundstrat, views this correction as normal and notes that previous bull market drawdowns were much larger (30%-50%). He believes that if the price falls to $70,000, it will be a strong support level, but if not, the $50,000 level could be tested. Despite the short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000 and sees this current correction as a normal part of its maturation process.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Italy's largest bank by assets, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made a significant move into the world of cryptocurrencies. According to a Reuters report, the bank has purchased 11 Bitcoins (BTC) for over $1 million. This investment is seen as a further entrenchment of Bitcoin in the traditional finance system. Intesa Sanpaolo's market capitalization stands at around $73 billion, making it one of the top 250 most valuable companies globally. The bank has had a proprietary trading desk for cryptocurrencies for several years and also handles spot trading for other digital assets.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US-regulated crypto product market has seen significant demand since BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) debuted on November 19. As of Monday, IBIT options contracts had a notional value of $11 billion, making up nearly half of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, which has a total notional value of $23 billion. This surge in demand is attributed to US-based investors seeking regulated markets. Volmex Finance notes that IBIT options appeal to institutional investors and retail traders alike, while challenging Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market. However, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers sees a positive impact from IBIT options, citing new arbitrage opportunities and enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutions. The majority of IBIT option activity is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating demand for lower-priced options.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. According to the article, Monday's price action suggests that BTC's price weakness may have run its course, as it rebounded from intraday lows and closed above $94,000. This is evident in a "long-legged Doji candle" pattern, which indicates downtrend exhaustion and potential bottom formation.

The article notes that this pattern has emerged at the same support zone ($90,000-$93,000) where BTC has consistently restricted its downside since late November. While confirmation of a bottom is required, chart-driven directional traders are waiting for a decisive move above Monday's high of $95,900 before entering fresh buy orders.

The article also mentions that corporate demand for BTC has outpaced the supply of new coins this year, indicating bullishly leaning demand-supply dynamics. The authors believe that price volatility may pick up again with Wednesday's US CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations.

Overall, the article suggests that BTC's price weakness may be coming to an end, but traders are still waiting for confirmation before entering new positions.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to provide a thorough explanation for refusing to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to determine whether crypto assets are securities or not. The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit partially sided with Coinbase, stating that instead of forcing the agency to make a rule, they should simply explain their decision not to. This is the second setback for the SEC in less than a week, and could leave an opening for the agency's new leadership to change its course on crypto oversight.

The ruling was seen as a rebuke of the SEC's approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, with one judge calling the agency's actions "arbitrary and capricious". The court did not find that Coinbase's arguments justified a clear need for new rules from the regulator. However, the judges did order the SEC to provide a more complete explanation for its decision.

Coinbase has been locked in a series of legal battles with the SEC, including an enforcement action against the exchange. This ruling could potentially pave the way for a change in direction on crypto oversight under the agency's new leadership.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is set to take over as Acting Chairman once current Chairman Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19. Before taking office, Hill has expressed his concerns about the FDIC's approach to regulating digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies. He believes that the agency's current piecemeal approach has stifled innovation and led to a public perception that the FDIC is closed to banks interested in blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Hill wants the agency to issue clear guidance on what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them safely. He also criticizes the FDIC for pressuring banks to drop crypto clients, which he believes goes against the goal of decreasing the number of unbanked individuals. Hill's comments suggest that he may take a more pro-crypto approach as Acting Chairman, at least temporarily.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it "has no intrinsic value" and is often used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This stance is consistent with his past opinions, despite the bank's involvement in bitcoin-related products, such as serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has rebranded its blockchain platform to focus on real-world tokenization, aiming to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. The move comes ahead of Donald Trump's return to the presidency, which is expected to bring a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, bond prices have declined over the same period.
