U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling to explain its decision not to write regulations for assessing whether crypto assets are securities or not, following a request from Coinbase. The SEC had refused to grant Coinbase's request, leading the court to rebuke the agency's lack of clarity on the matter. The judges called the SEC's actions "arbitrary and capricious" and demanded that the agency provide a more complete explanation for its decision. This is seen as a significant blow to the SEC, which has been criticized for its approach to crypto oversight. The ruling comes just ahead of a change in leadership at the SEC, with Chair Gary Gensler stepping down soon. The new chair or acting chairman may have the opportunity to address this issue and provide clarity on the matter.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), who is expected to take over as interim chairman after current Chairman Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19. Prior to taking office, Hill outlined his thoughts on pro-crypto policy, calling for the FDIC to issue new guidance on digital assets and end its piecemeal approach to supervising crypto in the banking system.

Hill criticized the agency's current approach, which he believes has stifled innovation and contributed to a public perception that the FDIC is closed to businesses interested in blockchain or distributed ledger technology. He suggested that the agency should clearly and transparently describe what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them in accordance with safety and soundness standards.

Hill also criticized the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable and that regulators must work to end this practice. He emphasized that there is no place at the FDIC for anyone who has pushed banks to stop serving law-abiding customers.

Overall, Hill's comments suggest a more pro-crypto approach from the FDIC, which could potentially benefit the cryptocurrency industry by providing greater clarity and guidance on regulatory requirements.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin (BTC) in an interview with CBS News, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is often used by criminals such as sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin. Notably, despite JPMorgan's own profits from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, Dimon remains unconvinced of its value. In contrast, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink underwent a change of heart on the topic. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has been developing its blockchain platform, Kinexys, which aims to tokenize real-world assets and reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure. The bank plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities by Q1 2025. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's reassumption of the US presidency, with promises to deliver a more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15:57 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Capital Group, a Los Angeles-based investment company with over $2.3 trillion in assets under management, has become a significant shareholder in Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel industry investor that has gained notoriety for its bitcoin treasury strategy. Since adopting this strategy in April 2024, Metaplanet's share price has increased by over 1,700%. Capital Group is also the second-largest shareholder of MicroStrategy, a company that holds a large amount of bitcoin, with Michael Saylor being the largest shareholder. Other notable investors include Vanguard Group, Morgan Stanley, and Jane Street Group.

MicroStrategy Added 2,530 Bitcoin for $243M, Bringing Holdings to 450K BTC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, a company led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has purchased 2,530 more Bitcoin (BTC) for $243 million, bringing its total holdings to 450,000 BTC. This is the tenth consecutive week that MicroStrategy has increased its Bitcoin holdings. The average price paid per Bitcoin was $95,972. Saylor recommends investing in Bitcoin rather than bonds, which he considers "toxic", as Bitcoin's value has significantly increased since 2020, while bond values have declined. As a result, shares of MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific (SMLR), which also acquired more BTC, have fallen by around 5% and 7%, respectively, in premarket trading.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent surge in the mining difficulty adjustment in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. The difficulty has risen to a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment, which puts pressure on miners as they compete to mine blocks and receive rewards.

The article also notes that some publicly traded miners have had to pivot into other industries such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to the increasing difficulty in mining Bitcoin. Additionally, MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out their Bitcoin at a single-digit yield.

The article highlights that this level of consecutive positive adjustments has occurred before, during the summer of 2021 shortly after the China mining ban, which led to a bear market in Bitcoin for most of 2022. However, it's also noted that this pattern has indicated near cycle tops and bottoms in the past.

Finally, the article points out that despite the increasing difficulty, the hashrate (the total computing power dedicated to mining) continues to rise, with some estimates suggesting that it could reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of the strong US jobs report on Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market. The report showed a higher-than-expected number of job additions and a decline in the unemployment rate, leading investment banks such as Goldman Sachs to reassess their expectations for Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts.

As a result, BTC prices dropped 1.6% to below $93,000, while other major cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE also fell. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the performance of major cryptocurrencies, was down over 3%.

In traditional markets, the S&P 500 futures index fell 0.3%, indicating an extension of Friday's decline, while the dollar index (DXY) rose to near a four-year high.

The strong jobs report led Goldman Sachs to push out its forecast for the next interest rate cut from March to June, with another potential rate cut in December 2026. Other banks such as JPMorgan and ING also expect rate cuts, but Bank of America (BofA) believes there is a risk of an extended pause or even a rate hike.

The article notes that the market is now focused on the upcoming release of the December consumer price index report, which could impact expectations for Fed policy.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report from Laser Digital, 2025 could be a big year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Up to 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposed ETFs include products that track the performance of the S&P 500 in bitcoin, as well as ETFs based on bitcoin, ether, litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report also notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC chairman Paul Atkins and the exit of Gary Gensler will lead to a decrease in lawsuits against crypto companies, making approval of new ETFs more likely. Additionally, the ETF market is expected to continue growing, with wider adoption by institutional investors anticipated in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The Singaporean Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to the prediction market platform Polymarket, citing that it is an "unlicensed gambling site". This means that users who attempt to access the platform may be liable for a fine of up to SGD 10,000 ($7200) or a jail sentence of up to 6 months. This follows similar actions taken by authorities in Taiwan and France, where users were blocked from accessing Polymarket. Additionally, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase to gather information about US nationals trading on Polymarket as part of an ongoing investigation.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impending release of billions of dollars worth of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) due to token unlocks. Specifically, Ondo Finance's ONDO token will see a massive unlock of 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion on January 18, which is equivalent to over 130% of its circulating supply. This large unlock could lead to increased volatility in the market. According to research by The Tie, tokens facing unlocks equivalent to 100% of their average daily volume experience volatility around the event. ONDO's current price is at $1.14, a 5% loss for the day and a nearly 15% decline for the month.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, has filed ethics agreements and financial disclosures to avoid potential conflicts of interest. His assets are worth over $700 million, including an investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) valued between $250,000 to $500,000. Other investments that may pose a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent would face the challenge of managing the federal debt amid Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate social security benefits taxes. As a pro-crypto advocate, Bessent's confirmation would likely involve navigating complex financial issues, including tax reform and deregulation efforts aimed at boosting bank lending and energy production.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced a backlash from its community after introducing a change to its yield-generating token, USD0++. The tweak allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par, which raised concerns about the protocol's design and communication with users. As a result, the value of USD0++ plummeted, briefly falling below $0.90 from its usual price of $1 on Curve, a decentralized marketplace. The protocol's governance token, USUAL, also dropped by as much as 17% before recovering some losses. The controversy highlights the potential risks of DeFi products that offer high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels. While the Usual team apologized for any misunderstanding and promised to improve communication, the episode serves as a lesson for investors about the importance of understanding the exact rules and being able to trust that they won't change.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving the agency after a relatively short tenure. During his time at the CFTC, he oversaw high-profile cases involving cryptocurrencies, including suing Binance and handling the aftermath of FTX's collapse. He also prioritized establishing the CFTC as a premier law enforcement agency for digital asset enforcement. McGinley's departure opens the door for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. The CFTC may take on a more prominent role in overseeing US digital assets markets if crypto legislation advances in 2025, surpassing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would significantly impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal would apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset, commonly the US dollar. This could have major implications for how US-based stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers operate.

The CFPB has opened the proposal for public comment, but its future is uncertain due to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The CFPB's director, Rohit Chopra, may not step down voluntarily, as Republican lawmakers have actively sought to weaken the agency's powers. Even if the regulation survives, it would need to be finalized and put into effect by a Trump-appointed leader.

The proposed regulation views stablecoins as a payment mechanism and suggests that existing law should include them in its definition of "funds." This could also include other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The proposal also includes virtual currency wallets in its definition of "accounts," which would require institutions providing such accounts to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers.

Some consumer advocacy groups have praised the proposal, while others, including the Cato Institute and Consensys, have criticized it as overly broad and not addressing decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets. The regulation's future is uncertain due to the incoming Trump administration, which could appoint a new CFPB chief who may not support the proposal.
