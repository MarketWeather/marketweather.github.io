Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the latest development in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining ecosystem. Specifically:

* The mining difficulty has reached a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than when Bitcoin first launched.
* This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners to continue mining and rewards them with Bitcoin.
* Historically, such records have preceded major market tops or bottoms in the past (e.g., summer of 2021, bull market top at $69,000; 2018, bull market top at $20,000). However, there is no clear trend that emerges when there are many positive consecutive adjustments.
* The article also highlights the increasing hashrate (the total processing power of the Bitcoin network) and notes that it is likely to reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event.

Overall, the article suggests that the recent surge in mining difficulty may be a sign of increased competition and pressure on miners, which could have implications for the market.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin's value dropped by 1.6% on Monday, reaching below $93,000, due to reassessments from major investment banks regarding Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts after a strong jobs report was released. The jobless rate decreased to 4.1%, and average hourly earnings came in slightly lower than expected, which led Goldman Sachs to push back the next interest rate cut to June from March. Other banks, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, still expect rate cuts, but Bank of America fears an extended pause or even a rate hike due to the strong jobs report. The article also mentions that the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield has surged by 100 basis points since the September rate cut, indicating that interest rates may be rising. Overall, the article suggests that the market is adjusting its expectations for Fed rate cuts and that Bitcoin's value may continue to fluctuate based on these changes.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report by Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. As many as 12 crypto ETFs may be launched this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Asset managers have already submitted 12 filings to the SEC, which includes potential products such as a bitcoin/ether ETF, litecoin, XRP, and Solana-based ETFs. The report suggests that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. This comes after the success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US last year, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) amassing $53 billion in assets under management. The report also notes that the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC and the expected wider adoption by institutional investors could further boost the growth of the ETF market.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The Singaporean Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform, citing it as an "unlicensed gambling site". The announcement warns that those found guilty of using the platform can face fines up to SGD 10,000 or imprisonment for up to 6 months. This is not the first time Polymarket has faced legal action; Taiwan had already blocked access to its citizens and arrested 17 people for betting on a recent presidential election. Additionally, gaming authorities in France have also taken action against the platform. Moreover, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase as part of an ongoing investigation into US nationals trading on Polymarket.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is expected to experience increased volatility this week due to the impending token unlock schedule. Specifically, Ondo Finance's ONDO token will release a massive amount of supply worth $2.23 billion, which is equivalent to over 130% of its circulating supply. This is the largest unlock since November and several times bigger than its daily trading volume. The gradual release of tokens aims to prevent rapid price swings and market instability. However, research suggests that unlocks equivalent to 100% of the average daily volume can lead to volatility in the days leading up to and following the event. As a result, ONDO's prices have been declining since reaching record highs in December, with a current price of $1.14, representing a 5% loss for the day and a nearly 15% month-to-date decline.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to divest some of his assets, including an investment in Bitcoin ETFs worth $250,000 to $500,000, due to potential conflicts of interest with his new role. As part of the confirmation process, Bessent filed an ethics agreement and financial disclosures revealing assets worth over $700 million, including a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and stakes in a conservative publisher. If confirmed, Bessent would need to manage the federal debt while implementing Trump's tax plans, which could include extending expiring tax cuts and eliminating taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol and its recent issues with its yield-generating token, USD0++. The protocol had seen a significant rise in popularity, with its total value locked (TVL) reaching $1.87 billion earlier this week. However, on Friday, the protocol's team introduced a change to the redemption mechanism of USD0++ tokens without warning, causing a sell-off and panic among investors.

The change, known as "dual-path exit," allows investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price or at par by giving up some of the rewards earned. This led to criticism from DeFi users who felt that the protocol had changed its design without warning, calling into question the 1:1 exchange rate.

The article quotes several prominent figures in the DeFi community expressing concerns about the sudden change and the potential risks it poses to investors. The Usual Protocol team has apologized for any confusion caused and stated that the change was communicated in advance from October. However, the episode is seen as a lesson for crypto investors about the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels.

As a result of the sell-off, USD0++ traded briefly below 90 cents and the protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted by up to 17%. The protocol's TVL also dropped to below $1.6 billion. Despite the setbacks, the article notes that USD0++ is still trading at around 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Enforcement Director Ian McGinley is leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) after a relatively short tenure. He arrived in February 2023 and oversaw high-profile cases against Binance, FTX, KuCoin, and Falcon Labs, among others. During his time at the agency, he emphasized the CFTC's focus on digital assets, stating that it had "risen to the challenge" of enforcing laws related to cryptocurrencies.

McGinley's departure opens the door for Republicans to take over the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over as chairman. Sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger are potential candidates for the chairmanship, along with former Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who currently heads policy at a16z crypto.

McGinley's priorities during his tenure included establishing the CFTC as a premier law enforcement agency for digital assets. His departure comes as the CFTC continues to play a key role in regulating the US digital assets markets, and could potentially overtake the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if crypto legislation makes headway in 2025.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that could significantly impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset, such as the US dollar. This would require institutions providing these accounts to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers.

The CFPB's proposal defines "funds" to include stablecoins and other fungible assets that can be used for payments or transactions. This could also apply to more volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The agency suggests that virtual currency wallets should be treated as financial accounts, subjecting them to regulatory requirements.

While the proposal has been met with some support from consumer advocacy groups, it has also received criticism from crypto enthusiasts and policy analysts who argue that the regulations are overly broad and could stifle innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The future of this proposal is uncertain, as it must survive the arrival of a Trump-appointed CFPB chief and potentially be repealed by Congress.

Key points:

* The CFPB has proposed regulating stablecoins and virtual wallets under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.
* The proposal defines "funds" to include stablecoins and other fungible assets that can be used for payments or transactions.
* Virtual currency wallets would be treated as financial accounts, subjecting them to regulatory requirements.
* The proposal's future is uncertain due to the upcoming arrival of a Trump-appointed CFPB chief and potential Congressional repeal.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is shifting its stance on cryptocurrency, with the Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi announcing plans to legalize and regulate the industry. This marks a change from previous warnings against the use of cryptocurrencies. The government aims to create a regulatory framework that will allow for the benefits of the industry while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. A draft policy on virtual assets and service providers was launched in December, with the goal of establishing a fair and competitive market for cryptocurrency players and fostering innovation and financial literacy. This change in stance comes after years of caution, with Kenya's central bank issuing warnings against cryptocurrency use in 2015. The country has seen significant growth in the industry, with a United Nations report showing that around 8.5% of Kenyans own cryptocurrencies.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges relate to their alleged operation of two crypto mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io, which were used to anonymize transactions and conceal the source of digital assets. The third individual, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, is at-large. Authorities had previously seized and dismantled the computer equipment behind the services, and Blender.io was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of cryptocurrency proceeds from North Korean hackers. The indictment alleges that the defendants operated these mixers to facilitate the laundering of criminally derived funds, including those from ransomware and wire fraud schemes. This prosecution is part of a larger effort to target crypto mixing services, which have been controversial due to their vulnerability to criminal use and their championing of financial privacy.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is collaborating with Fiamma and the Cosmos network to create a trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge. This bridge will enhance Bitcoin's interoperability by allowing transactions between different blockchains. The project utilizes BitVM2, a computing paradigm that enables Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin, paving the way for zero-knowledge technology. Zero-knowledge computations allow parties to verify information without revealing what it is.

The goal of this initiative is to unlock the value stored in BTC and enable its use as collateral for other ecosystems and blockchains. This movement aims to extract greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to how Ethereum's network works. Babylon Labs' staking protocol has a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion.

The introduction of BitVM2's predecessor was hailed as a breakthrough in making Bitcoin more programmable, enabling faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security. This will allow bridges to securely transfer BTC between networks and bring it back for withdrawals.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

16:21 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Crypto exchange Bybit has announced that it will temporarily suspend its services in India due to regulatory requirements. Starting Sunday, Indian users will no longer be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, except for withdrawals. The suspension is intended to prevent any issues with compliance with Indian laws and regulations. However, Bybit hopes to complete the registration process as a Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDS) under Indian law in the coming weeks, after which it plans to resume full services.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

13:39 10 Jan 2025

The US job market experienced a strong growth in December, with the addition of 256,000 jobs, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in November. This positive news triggered a reaction in financial markets, with:

* Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experiencing losses, with bitcoin dropping over 2% to $92,800.
* US stock index futures falling around 1%.
* The 10-year Treasury yield rising 9 basis points to 4.78%.
* The dollar index surging 0.6%.
* Gold prices moving modestly lower to just below $2,700 per ounce.

The strong jobs report led traders to scale back bets on further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025, with the odds of a March move declining from 41% to 28%, and May rate cut odds falling from 44% to 34%. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December, with a year-over-year increase of 3.9%.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

13:32 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses a recent positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, specifically with regards to XRP, DOGE, and XLM. Prices for these tokens have increased on both Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and Binance (an offshore exchange), indicating renewed participation from stateside investors. The "Coinbase premium" metric, which measures the difference between prices on Coinbase and Binance, has surged for these tokens in early December following Bitcoin's price surge to lifetime highs. However, when Bitcoin's uptrend slowed down due to hawkish Fed expectations, the premium quickly turned into a discount.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

12:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, has released a new music video despite facing imprisonment for her role in laundering stolen cryptocurrency from Bitfinex. Her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein, was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft, with Morgan receiving an 18-month sentence. The song, "Razzlekhan vs. The United States", is a tongue-in-cheek commentary that does not directly attack the investigation or court proceedings. Instead, it critiques societal issues and features Morgan bound in red ropes. Morgan has stated that her Razzlekhan performances are meant to be inspiring for creatives and misfits who feel alone. Despite being sentenced, Morgan's prison sentence was delayed until the end of January, and she will have restricted computer use.

This trend started on January 9th and continued until January 10th, with the price rising from $91,771 to $95,283. The senior analyst at K33 Research, Vetle Lunde, notes that this is the longest hourly green candle streak since at least January 1st, 2017. While not unprecedented, this rare event has left traders perplexed.

Sentiment Readings Favor Dogecoin Gains as Cardano’s ADA Leads Market Bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:47 10 Jan 2025

The article suggests that after a weakness in Bitcoin (BTC), other cryptocurrencies such as Solana's SOL, Dogecoin (DOGE), and potentially others may see an increase in value. Specifically, Dogecoin has been quiet recently but its market capitalization has dropped 28% since its peak one month ago, making it ripe for contrarian investors to buy in. The article cites Santiment analytics firm, which notes that crowd sentiment on DOGE is at a low point of 1 out of 5, indicating potential upside.

Large investors, or "whales," are showing increased interest in DOGE, with transactions over $100,000 spiking, suggesting potential price bumps in the short term. The article also mentions that January has been Dogecoin's best-performing month historically, averaging an 85% return.

The sentiment for other major cryptocurrencies is mixed: Bitcoin is neutral after a dip and recovery, Ether sees bearish sentiment despite holding above $3,000, XRP is bullish after an 18% rise in the past week, Binance Coin shows neutral sentiment post-drop below $700. Solana remains semi-bullish despite underperformance.

The article also mentions that Cardano's ADA led a market-wide recovery on Friday with a 5.5% move, and the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) rose 1.04%. Other AI Agent tokens, such as Bixby, Cookie DAO's COOKIE, and ChainGPT, have seen significant gains, up to 50%, on Binance spot listings.

EU's MiCA Rules Will Likely Boost Euro Denominated Stablecoins, JPMorgan Says
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:35 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The EU's new MiCA regulations, which came into effect on Dec. 30, are expected to benefit euro-denominated stablecoins that comply with the rules. As a result, compliant stablecoins like Circle's EURC have gained strength, while non-compliant ones like Tether's EURT face challenges. Under MiCA, stablecoin issuers must maintain significant reserves in European banks and secure licenses for trading. In response, Tether has discontinued its EURT stablecoin and delisted USDT from several EU-based exchanges. Despite these challenges, Tether remains a dominant force globally and is widely used in Asian markets where regulations are less strict. The company has also invested in MiCA-compliant stablecoin issuers like Quantoz Payments and StablR to maintain a presence in the EU.
