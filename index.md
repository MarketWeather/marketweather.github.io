U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is set to get new management, with current Vice Chairman Travis Hill expected to take over as interim chairman after Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19. In remarks made before his potential takeover, Hill expressed concerns about the FDIC's approach to cryptocurrency regulation, calling for a more transparent and clearly outlined guidance for banks interested in digital assets. He criticized the agency's piecemeal approach, which has led to many banks being discouraged from pursuing crypto-related business lines. Hill also condemned the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to cut ties with crypto clients, stating that efforts to "debank" law-abiding customers are unacceptable.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative view on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by criminals such as sex traffickers and money launderers. This is consistent with his previous opposition to Bitcoin, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who had a change of heart. Despite JPMorgan's profiting from Bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, Dimon remains skeptical. However, the bank has been investing in blockchain technology and rebranding its platform to focus on tokenizing real-world assets. This move aims to improve the current financial infrastructure, although it's unclear how this will be impacted by the expected friendlier regulatory environment for Bitcoin and crypto under the new U.S. presidency led by Donald Trump.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15:57 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Capital Group, a large investment company with over $2.3 trillion in assets under management, has become one of the biggest shareholders of Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel industry investor that has gained attention for its bitcoin treasury strategy. Metaplanet holds 1,762 BTC and has seen its share price increase by over 1,700% since adopting the strategy in April 2024. Capital Group also owns a significant stake in MicroStrategy, a Bitcoin development company founded by Michael Saylor, with an 8% stake in the company.

MicroStrategy Added 2,530 Bitcoin for $243M, Bringing Holdings to 450K BTC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has continued its streak of buying Bitcoin (BTC) for the tenth consecutive week. In the latest week ending January 12, MicroStrategy purchased 2,530 BTC for $243 million, bringing their total holdings to 450,000 BTC. The company's average purchase price is now $62,691.

Saylor teased the announcement on Twitter on Sunday. However, shares of MicroStrategy fell nearly 5% in premarket trading, along with a similar dip in Bitcoin prices, which are currently hovering around $90,000.

Semler Scientific (SMLR), another company, also announced that it has acquired an additional 237 BTC for $23.3 million at an average price of $98,267. SMLR now holds 2,321 BTC worth $191.9 million, with an average purchase price of $82,867. Shares of Semler Scientific dropped almost 7% in premarket trading.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses recent records set in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. The mining difficulty adjustment has reached an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than when Bitcoin was first launched. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as they compete to mine a block and receive bitcoin rewards.

The article notes that some publicly traded miners have had to diversify into other industries, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), due to the increasing difficulty. Additionally, MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out its bitcoin at a single-digit yield.

The article also highlights that this is not the first time Bitcoin has seen a streak of consecutive positive adjustments in difficulty. In 2021, there were nine such adjustments following the China mining ban, which led to a bull market top when bitcoin hit around $69,000. Conversely, in 2018, there were 17 positive adjustments followed by a negative adjustment and then six more positive ones before the price dropped.

While there is no clear trend emerging from these consecutive positive adjustments, they have been indicative of near-cycle tops and bottoms in the past. The article also notes that the continued strength of the hashrate (measured at 775 EH/s on a 7-day moving average) suggests that it may reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses how Bitcoin's price fell by 1.6% due to reassessments of Federal Reserve rate cuts following a strong jobs report on Friday. The report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 in December, surpassing expectations and prompting investment banks such as Goldman Sachs to adjust their expectations for future rate cuts. As a result, Bitcoin's price dipped below $93,000 and major coins like XRP, ADA, and DOGE posted bigger losses. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down over 3%.

In traditional markets, the S&P 500 futures traded 0.3% lower, while the dollar index (DXY) neared 110 for the first time since late 2022. Treasury yields also rose, supporting further gains.

The jobs report led Goldman Sachs to push out its next interest rate cut to June from March, and another rate cut in June 2026. The bank's economists now expect the Fed to cut just twice in 2025. Bank of America, on the other hand, fears an extended pause or even a rate hike.

ING said that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed, and warned that if core inflation comes in at 0.3% month-on-month for a fifth consecutive month next week, it could increase the view that the Fed will not cut rates as expected.

Overall, the article suggests that the strong jobs report has led to a reassessment of rate cut expectations, which is impacting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to Laser Digital, a subsidiary of financial services giant Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company predicts that over 12 crypto ETFs could be launched in the US this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These products include a ProShares ETF that tracks the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, as well as ETFs focused on combined indices, such as bitcoin/ether, and individual coins like litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is expected to be approved first. The report notes that the success of spot bitcoin ETFs launched last year, which attracted $53 billion in assets under management, bodes well for the future of crypto ETFs. Additionally, the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators may lead to a decrease in lawsuits against crypto companies and an increase in institutional investor adoption of ETFs in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Singapore Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. This follows similar actions by authorities in Taiwan and France, who have banned their citizens from using the platform. In Taiwan, 17 people were arrested for betting on the country's presidential election. The GRA warns that accessing unlicensed gambling sites can result in fines up to SGD 10,000 or imprisonment of up to 6 months. Additionally, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase to gather information about US nationals trading on Polymarket as part of an ongoing investigation.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the upcoming token unlock schedule for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which is expected to release billions of dollars worth of supply into the market. Specifically, Ondo Finance's ONDO token will be unlocked, releasing 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion, which is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply. This sudden increase in supply has the potential to inject volatility into the market. Historically, unlocks that are equivalent to 100% of a token's average daily volume can lead to price swings and market instability. ONDO's unlock is particularly significant because it will release more tokens than its daily trading volume, which could exacerbate the situation. As a result, investors may experience increased volatility in the days leading up to and following the unlock.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to dispose of several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest if confirmed. The assets include an investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) worth $250,000 to $500,000, as well as other investments with Goldman Sachs and a stake in conservative publisher All Seasons. Bessent has filed ethics agreements and financial disclosures showing assets worth over $700 million. In a letter to the ethics office, he promised to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest if confirmed. If confirmed, Bessent would face the challenge of managing the federal debt amid Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced backlash from its community after introducing a change to its yield-generating token without warning. The tweak in the protocol's USD0++ token, which represents staked versions of its $1-anchored stablecoin USD0, triggered a sell-off on secondary markets. As a result, the USD0++ token briefly fell below 90 cents from $1 and the protocol's governance token USUAL plummeted by as much as 17% before recovering some losses.

The issue arose from the introduction of a "dual-path exit" feature that allows investors to redeem locked-up tokens early at a price floor, which was not clearly communicated to users. This change caught yield farmers off-guard and caused market panic, leading to a significant drop in the protocol's total value locked (TVL) metric.

The Usual team apologized for the communication breakdown and emphasized that the design change had been announced in advance, but many users felt that it was not adequately explained. The episode serves as a reminder of the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yields and token incentives, and highlights the importance of transparent communication to users.

As of now, USD0++ is trading at 0.91 USD0 in the Curve pool, while the protocol's TVL has dropped below $1.6 billion.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Enforcement Director Ian McGinley is leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) after a relatively short tenure that saw several high-profile cases related to cryptocurrency. During his time at the agency, he oversaw the conclusion of the enforcement work against collapsed platform FTX, which resulted in the largest recovery of dollars for victims in CFTC history. McGinley also played a key role in the CFTC's efforts to regulate digital assets, stating that the agency had "risen to the challenge" in addressing this area.

McGinley's departure opens up an opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over as chairman. Sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger are potential candidates for the chairmanship, along with former Commissioner Brian Quintenz. If crypto legislation advances in 2025, the CFTC could potentially surpass the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the dominant agency overseeing US digital assets markets.

Overall, McGinley's departure marks a significant change at the CFTC, which has been actively pursuing cases related to cryptocurrency. The agency's focus on digital assets is likely to continue under new leadership.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations for stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal would apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset like the US dollar. This could have significant implications for US-based stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers.

The proposal suggests that existing law references to "funds" should include stablecoins and other fungible assets that operate as a medium of exchange or means of payment. Additionally, the regulation would require institutions providing virtual currency wallets to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers.

However, the proposal's future is uncertain due to the upcoming arrival of President-elect Donald Trump, who will have the power to appoint a new CFPB chief. The current director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily. Furthermore, the Republican-led Congress has the authority to erase the regulation using the Congressional Review Act.

The proposal has received both praise and criticism from industry experts and consumer advocacy groups. Better Markets applauded the move, saying it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, some critics argue that the CFPB's arguments are "embarrassingly conclusory" and fail to consider decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The proposal is now open for public comment, but its fate remains uncertain due to the potential change in leadership at the CFPB.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is shifting its stance on cryptocurrency by preparing legislation to legalize and regulate the industry. This marks a change from the government's previous warnings against the use of virtual assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). According to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, the country aims to create a regulatory framework that balances the benefits of cryptocurrencies with risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on VAs and VASPs in December, which aims to establish a competitive market, foster innovation, and promote financial literacy. This move is significant, considering Kenya's central bank previously warned against cryptocurrency use in 2015 and the country was considering taxing crypto transactions in 2022. With an estimated 8.5% of Kenyans owning cryptocurrencies, the government's new approach is seen as a step towards embracing the growth of the industry.
