Analysis: Prediction Markets Have a Gambling Problem
----------------------------------------------------

17:14 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the challenges faced by prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi in convincing regulators that their services are not gambling. While these platforms are considered investment tools designed to forecast outcomes based on probabilities, they are often viewed as unlicensed gambling operations by authorities outside of the US. Taiwan, France, and Singapore have all blocked users from accessing Polymarket, citing concerns about the platform's lack of regulation.

In contrast, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the US views prediction markets as a collection of event contracts similar to weather derivatives, which are used by farmers to hedge against crop loss. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have had issues with the CFTC, with Polymarket settling the matter and Kalshi winning permission to offer election-based event contracts.

The article highlights the growing popularity of prediction markets, particularly in the sports betting space. With over $1.1 billion in volume bet on the outcome of the NFL Super Bowl alone, it's clear that these platforms are resonating with users. However, regulators may view this as online sports betting, which requires stringent licensing requirements.

The author suggests that while there is room for sports-themed prediction market contracts, the lack of regulation outside of the US presents a significant challenge. In jurisdictions where online sportsbooks are licensed and regulated, it's possible that similar restrictions will be placed on prediction markets.

Ultimately, the article concludes that Polymarket may need to consider moving to a more regulatory-friendly jurisdiction, such as Canada, which allows both political and sports betting.

Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent volatility in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which has been swinging between fear and greed. After falling below $90,000, BTC is now above $96,500, up over 8%. Tom Lee, a bitcoin bull and head of research at Fundstrat, views this correction as normal, citing that it's down only 15% from its highs for a volatile asset. He notes that Glassnode data shows that this current cycle has seen relatively mild drawdowns compared to previous bull markets.

Lee also highlights two key support levels: $70,000 and $50,000. If the prior $70,000 level doesn't hold, he believes the $50,000 level could be tested. He uses Fibonacci levels or retracement periods to analyze the price action, which suggests that the asset is becoming more mature.

Despite the short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000 for 2025.

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has seen significant demand for its regulated crypto products. The IBIT options market is now almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, with 2.16 million open or active contracts worth $11 billion. This growth is attributed to US-based investors seeking regulated markets and institutional investors. While Deribit has historically dominated the crypto options market, its CEO believes that IBIT options have created positive ripple effects by introducing new opportunities for arbitrage and risk-offloading strategies.

Key points:

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC), specifically its sudden drop and subsequent recovery. The author suggests that Monday's price movement may be a sign of a potential bottom, as indicated by the formation of a "long-legged Doji candle" at a key support level. This pattern is often seen as a signal of downtrend exhaustion and can be a sign of a turning point in the market.

The article notes that BTC initially fell below its key support zone of $90,000-$93,000 due to investment banks scaling back expectations for Fed rate cuts and the potential for rate hikes following a strong jobs report. However, the price quickly rebounded and closed above $94,000, indicating buyer demand.

The author suggests that while Monday's price action hints at a potential bottom, confirmation is needed in the form of a decisive move above the day's high of $95,900. Additionally, the bears will need to see the price drop below Monday's low near $89,000 before they can consider the selling pressure increased.

The article also notes that BTC's demand-supply dynamics continue to lean bullishly, with corporate demand for BTC outpacing new coin supply this year. The author suggests that price volatility may pick up again on the back of Wednesday's U.S. CPI report, which could influence Fed rate cut expectations.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been ordered by a circuit court to provide a clear explanation for its refusal to write regulations on how to classify crypto assets as securities or not. The ruling was issued in response to a petition filed by Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC had refused to grant Coinbase's request for clarity on the matter, leading the court to rule that the agency's decision was "arbitrary and capricious." The judges suggested that the SEC could simply state its position on crypto assets unequivocally rather than forcing it to make a new rule. This is seen as an opportunity for the incoming SEC leadership, with Chair Gary Gensler stepping down and Paul Atkins taking over, to change course on crypto oversight.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Travis Hill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has expressed his support for pro-crypto policies ahead of taking over as interim chairman. He criticized the agency's current approach to regulating digital assets, calling it "stifling innovation" and contributing to a negative public perception. Hill wants the FDIC to issue clear guidance on what activities are legally permissible in regards to blockchain and distributed ledger technology. He also condemned the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to debank law-abiding customers are unacceptable. Current Chairman Martin Gruenberg will step down on January 19, allowing Hill to take over as interim chairman until a new permanent chairman is appointed.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative view on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is often used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. Despite the bank's profits from Bitcoin-related services, such as serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, Dimon's views have not changed. This stands in contrast to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who reversed his stance on Bitcoin a few years ago. JPMorgan is, however, investing in blockchain technology and real-world tokenization through its platform Kinexys, which aims to reduce limitations in the financial infrastructure. The comments came just days before Donald Trump's reassumption of the US presidency, with promises to create a more friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
