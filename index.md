Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The Bitcoin mining difficulty has hit an all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder to mine a block than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as they need to increase their computing power to maintain profitability. Some publicly traded miners have diversified into high-performance computing and artificial intelligence industries due to the increasing difficulty. The article also notes that MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and optimize revenue by lending out their Bitcoin at a single-digit yield. The author points out that similar consecutive positive adjustments occurred in 2021, following China's mining ban, and in 2018, during the bull market top. While there is no clear trend emerging from this data, it has historically indicated near cycle tops or bottoms. The article concludes by highlighting the continued strength of the Bitcoin network's hash rate, which is on track to reach 1 zettahash per second before the next halving event.

Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Bitcoin (BTC) prices dropped by 1.6% on Monday, reaching below $93,000, following a strong jobs report released on Friday. The report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in unemployment rate, which led to reassessments from major investment banks about Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts. Goldman Sachs now expects only two rate cuts in 2025, whereas JPMorgan still expects rate cuts. Bank of America, on the other hand, warns of an extended pause or even a rate hike due to concerns over inflation. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks major cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE, fell by over 3%. The US dollar index (DXY) rose near 110 for the first time since late 2022, and Treasury yields increased as well. The article suggests that the strong jobs report may have completed a pendulum swing towards inflation, making it less likely for the Fed to cut interest rates in the near future.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

According to a report from Laser Digital, a digital asset subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received over 12 filings from asset managers to launch crypto ETFs in the US, with potential products including a bitcoin/ether ETF, litecoin, XRP, and Solana-based ETFs. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The report notes that the success of spot bitcoin ETFs launched last year, which saw BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust amass $53 billion in assets under management, increases the likelihood of approval for new ETFs. Additionally, the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC and the exit of Gary Gensler are expected to lead to a decrease in lawsuits against crypto companies, making the approval process smoother. The report also suggests that the ETF market will continue to grow and see wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025, with President-elect Donald Trump's return to office and a team of crypto-friendly regulators supporting this growth.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The article reports that Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. The GRA issued a warning stating that accessing the site is illegal and punishable by fines up to SGD 10,000 ($7200) or imprisonment for up to 6 months. This follows similar actions taken by authorities in Taiwan, France, and the US. In Taiwan, 17 people were arrested for betting on Polymarket's presidential election predictions, which are prohibited under local law. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also launched an investigation into Polymarket activity, issuing a subpoena to Coinbase regarding US nationals trading on the platform.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is expected to experience increased volatility this week due to the impending token unlock schedule. The unlocks will release billions of dollars worth of supply for several coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. Specifically, ONDO's upcoming unlock on January 18 will free up 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion, which is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply. This massive unlock could inject volatility into the market, as it is significantly larger than the coin's daily trading volume. Historically, when a token faces an unlock that is equivalent to its average daily volume, prices tend to experience volatility in the lead-up and following the event. As a result, ONDO's price has been declining sharply, losing nearly 15% of its value in the past month and falling to its lowest point since December 2.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05:16 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, plans to divest several assets worth over $700 million to avoid potential conflicts of interest. This includes an investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) valued between $250,000 and $500,000. Other investments that could pose a conflict include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, a trading account for China's currency, and a stake in conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent would face the challenge of managing federal debt amid Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits. As an advocate for tax reform and deregulation, Bessent is expected to play a key role in shaping economic policy under the new administration.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the controversy surrounding Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to stake their funds and earn rewards. The protocol's USD0++ token, which represents a locked-up version of its stablecoin USD0, experienced a significant price drop after the team introduced a new feature called "dual-path exit" without warning. This feature allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par by giving up some of the rewards earned.

The sudden change in the protocol's mechanism caused confusion and panic among users, leading to a sell-off on secondary markets. The token's price fell briefly below 90 cents from $1 on Curve, and the protocol's governance token, USUAL, plummeted as much as 17% before recovering some of its losses.

The controversy highlights the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yield incentives and rewards. It emphasizes the importance of clear communication and transparency in DeFi protocols to prevent market panic and maintain user trust.

Key points:

* Usual Protocol's USD0++ token experienced a significant price drop after the team introduced a new feature without warning.
* The "dual-path exit" feature allows investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a 0.87 USD0 floor price, or at par by giving up some of the rewards earned.
* The sudden change in the protocol's mechanism caused confusion and panic among users, leading to a sell-off on secondary markets.
* The controversy highlights the potential risks associated with DeFi products that offer high-yield incentives and rewards.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position in one week. During his relatively short tenure, which began in February 2023, McGinley oversaw several high-profile cases involving cryptocurrency companies, including Binance and FTX. He characterized the conclusion of the FTX case as the largest recovery of dollars for victims in CFTC history. The agency has also pursued enforcement actions against KuCoin and Falcon Labs. McGinley's departure opens up a opportunity for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. Potential candidates for the role include sitting Republican commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger, as well as former Commissioner Brian Quintenz.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would significantly impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset like the US dollar. This would require institutions providing these accounts to make consumer disclosures, protect against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers.

The proposal has significant implications for the way U.S. stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers do business. However, its future is uncertain due to the upcoming change in government leadership under President-elect Donald Trump. The CFPB's director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily, but Trump could replace him with a new appointee.

The proposal would require virtual currency wallets that can be used for retail transactions to fall under regulatory requirements. This could run afoul of the way crypto operations are often set up, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms without outside interference or self-hosted wallets.

Some consumer advocacy groups, like Better Markets, support the proposal, arguing it would protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, others, like the Cato Institute's Jack Solowey, criticize the move, saying the CFPB's arguments are "embarrassingly conclusory" and do not address decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The proposal is currently open for public comment and must survive a Trump-appointed leader before it can be finalized. Even if it becomes a final rule, Congress could erase it using its Congressional Review Act authority.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies, reversing its previous warnings against the industry. The government has launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers, aiming to establish a fair and competitive market for cryptocurrency players while managing risks such as money laundering and fraud. This shift in stance comes after Kenya's central bank issued a warning against cryptocurrency use in 2015, stating that it was not legal tender in the country. The new policy aims to capitalize on the potential benefits of the industry while mitigating its risks.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

17:25 10 Jan 2025

Three Russian nationals, Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, have been charged with money laundering by a federal grand jury in Georgia. The charges relate to their operation of two cryptocurrency mixing services, Blender.io and Sinbad.io, which were previously sanctioned by the US Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of crypto proceeds from cyber thefts conducted by North Korean hackers. The services allegedly served as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including ransomware and wire fraud. A third individual tied to the services, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, is at-large. Authorities have seized and dismantled the computer equipment behind the services, marking a significant step in the prosecution of crypto mixing services, which has been a contentious issue for US policymakers and members of Congress.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16:46 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of a large-scale BTC staking protocol, is building a trust-minimized bridge to connect Bitcoin with the Cosmos network. This bridge will enable interoperability between the two networks and allow for the transfer of value without compromising security or speed. To achieve this, Babylon Labs is using BitVM2, a computing paradigm that allows for the execution of Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin.

BitVM2's predecessor was hailed as a breakthrough for making Bitcoin more programmable, enabling faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security. This will allow for bridges to securely transfer BTC to other networks and bring it back, allowing for deposits to be withdrawn.

The goal is to unlock the value stored in BTC and enable it to be used on blockchains that are free of some of Bitcoin's limitations. This is part of a broader movement to extract greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to what is seen on networks like Ethereum.

Babylon Labs' Bitcoin staking protocol has already achieved significant success, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion. The introduction of BitVM2 and its bridge technology is expected to further enhance the interoperability and usability of BTC.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

16:21 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Crypto exchange Bybit, based in Dubai, will temporarily suspend services for its Indian users starting Sunday. The only exception will be allowing withdrawals from the platform. This move is in response to new regulations in India that require crypto companies to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with anti-money laundering measures. Bybit is working on completing its registration process, which it expects to finalize in the coming weeks, after which it plans to resume full service for its Indian users.
