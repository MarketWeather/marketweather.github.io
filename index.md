Spot Bitcoin ETFs Exceeded Expectations in 2024, but Just Wait for 2025
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

19:12 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the remarkable performance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their first year on the market. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had a particularly successful launch, accumulating over $52 billion in assets, making it the most successful ETF launch in US history. Three other spot Bitcoin ETFs also made it into the top 20 US ETF launches of all time. The majority of inflows came from non-professional investors, but institutional investors are expected to increase their participation in the future. Experts predict that 2025 will be a big year for crypto ETFs, with over 50 new approvals expected under new leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This could include spot funds for Solana and XRP, as well as options-based and equities-based products.

Analysis: Prediction Markets Have a Gambling Problem
----------------------------------------------------

17:14 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the challenges faced by prediction market platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi in convincing regulators that their services are not gambling. Prediction markets allow users to buy and sell contracts based on the outcome of certain events, such as elections or sports games. While these platforms have been successful in the US, where they are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), they face opposition from international authorities who view them as unlicensed gambling operations.

The article highlights that outside of the US, countries such as Taiwan, France, and Singapore have blocked users from accessing Polymarket, viewing it as an unlicensed gambling operation. This is because prediction markets are often seen as synonymous with gambling, particularly when they involve sports events or other outcomes that are not necessarily financially significant.

However, in the US, the CFTC views prediction markets as a type of financial instrument, similar to weather derivatives used by farmers to hedge against crop loss. As a result, Polymarket and Kalshi have had to navigate regulatory issues, with Polymarket settling with the CFTC and Kalshi winning permission to offer election-based event contracts.

The article also notes that prediction markets can be useful tools for forecasting outcomes based on probabilities, rather than games of luck. For example, during the 2024 election, prediction markets allowed users to hedge their bets against a particular outcome, such as a significant price correction in crypto markets if Trump lost.

Despite the challenges faced by these platforms, the article suggests that there may still be room for sports-themed prediction market contracts, particularly in jurisdictions where online sports betting is legal. For example, Ontario allows both political and sports betting, making it an attractive location for Polymarket to operate.

Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent market volatility in Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen a swing from fear to greed. Despite falling below $90,000 on Monday, Bitcoin recovered to be above $96,500 on Tuesday, up 8%. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, believes this correction is normal for a volatile asset and expects the price to stabilize around $70,000, which he considers a strong support level. If this level doesn't hold, Lee thinks the price could potentially drop to $50,000. However, despite the short-term correction, Lee remains bullish on Bitcoin's prospects in 2025, predicting end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000. The article also mentions that Glassnode data shows relatively mild drawdowns in this current cycle compared to previous bull market corrections.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the growing demand for regulated crypto products in the US market. Specifically, it highlights the success of BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which was approved by the SEC and launched on November 19. The ETF's options contracts, known as IBIT options, have seen significant trading activity, with nearly 2.16 million open or active contracts representing a notional value of $11 billion. This is almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market.

The article notes that IBIT options appeal to both institutional investors and US retail traders who prefer regulated markets. The growing demand for IBIT options is challenging Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market, but Deribit's CEO, Luuk Strijers, believes that this competition has created positive ripple effects for the industry by introducing new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants.

The article also notes that activity in IBIT options is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a demand for lower premium (priced) options. Overall, the article suggests that the US market is increasingly demanding regulated crypto products, and IBIT options are meeting this demand.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price movement of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether it has reached a bottom. On Monday, BTC's price initially fell due to uncertainty around Federal Reserve rate cuts following a strong jobs report, but then quickly rebounded and closed above $94,000. This "long-legged Doji candle" pattern is often seen as a sign of downtrend exhaustion and potential bottom formation. The article notes that this pattern has emerged at a key support zone that has been restricting the downside since late November. To confirm a potential bottom, traders are waiting for a decisive move above Monday's high of $95,900. In the meantime, the bears' next target is Monday's low near $89,000. The article also mentions that corporate demand for BTC has outpaced new coin supply this year, indicating bullish demand dynamics. Market participants are now focused on signs of stability to determine if there will be further downside or upside movement ahead of Wednesday's U.S. CPI report.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to thoroughly explain its decision not to grant Coinbase's request for regulations on how to determine if crypto assets are securities or not. The SEC had refused to provide clarity on the matter, leading Coinbase to seek legal action. The court ruled that the SEC's actions were "arbitrary and capricious" and partially sided with Coinbase, ordering the agency to explain its decision rather than forcing it to create a new rule.

The ruling is seen as a setback for the SEC, which has been criticized for its lack of clarity on crypto regulations under the leadership of Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler will be stepping down soon, and his replacement may have an opportunity to change the agency's approach on crypto oversight.

Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, welcomed the ruling and thanked the court for their careful consideration. The SEC has until now been criticized for its lack of transparency and clarity on crypto regulations, with Judge Stephanos Bibas warning that the agency should not provide a "poor explanation" in response to this ruling.

The ruling may open the door for new leadership at the SEC to review and potentially change its approach on crypto oversight.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses Travis Hill, the Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), who is expected to take over as Chairman temporarily or permanently once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Before his potential takeover, Hill has outlined some pro-crypto policy thoughts. He believes that the FDIC's current approach to regulating digital assets has stifled innovation and contributed to a negative public perception of the agency. Hill suggests that the agency should issue new guidance for digital assets and clearly describe what activities are legally permissible, in order to promote safety and soundness standards. He also criticizes the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to debank law-abiding customers are unacceptable. The article notes that current Chairman Martin Gruenberg will step down on January 19, allowing Hill to take over as interim Chairman.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This is consistent with his previous opinions, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who had a change of heart. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase has profited from the growing use of Bitcoin as a financial product and even serves as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. The bank has also rebranded its blockchain platform to Kinexys and plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's return to the presidency, which is expected to bring a more friendly regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.
