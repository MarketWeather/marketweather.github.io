Spot Bitcoin ETFs Exceeded Expectations in 2024, but Just Wait for 2025
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

19:12 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the performance of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their first year on the market. According to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, the launch was "MASSIVE", with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust accumulating over $52.3 billion in assets in its first year. Three other spot bitcoin ETFs also had a successful launch, ranking among the top 20 U.S. ETF launches of all time. The majority of inflows came from non-professional investors, but some hedge funds and pension funds also invested modest amounts.

The article suggests that the record flows may continue in 2025, with more support from financial advisors and wire houses expected. Additionally, Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, predicts that over 50 more crypto ETFs will be approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2025, including spot Solana and XRP funds, as well as options-based and equities-based products.

Overall, the article concludes that the first year for Bitcoin ETFs was a huge success, exceeding expectations and potentially setting the stage for further growth and adoption in the coming years.

Analysis: Prediction Markets Have a Gambling Problem
----------------------------------------------------

17:14 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the challenges faced by prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi in convincing regulators that their services are not gambling. While outside the US, authorities view prediction markets as synonymous with gambling, and have blocked users from accessing these platforms at the ISP level. In contrast, the CFTC in the US views prediction markets as a collection of event contracts, similar to weather derivatives, which are used by farmers to hedge against crop loss.

Polymarket and Kalshi have both had issues with the CFTC, with Polymarket settling its case and Kalshi winning permission to offer election-based event contracts. Kalshi has also gained an advisor in Donald Trump Jr., who is helping its case with regulators.

The article notes that sports-themed prediction market contracts are a significant portion of Polymarket's volume, with over $1.1 billion bet on the outcome of the NFL Super Bowl, Champion's League, and NBA Finals. However, the article argues that these contracts lack macro-level importance, unlike election or business decisions, and resemble online sports betting.

The author suggests that prediction market platforms may face increased scrutiny from state-level gaming regulators in the US, particularly if online sports gaming giants like MGM push for regulation. The article concludes by noting that while there is room for sports-themed prediction market contracts, the smartest bet may be on a change of scenery, and the possibility of moving to jurisdictions like Canada where both political and sports betting are allowed.

Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End
-------------------------------------------------------------------

12:07 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent fluctuations in Bitcoin's price, which has been oscillating between $90,000 and $100,000. Despite a brief dip below $90,000 on Monday, the cryptocurrency is now trading above $96,500, with an 8% increase. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, views this correction as normal for a volatile asset like Bitcoin. He notes that previous bull market drawdowns saw declines of up to 30%-50%, whereas this current cycle has seen relatively mild corrections of around 15%-20%. Lee identifies $70,000 as a strong support level and suggests that if this level is broken, the price could potentially drop to $50,000. However, he remains bullish on Bitcoin's prospects for 2025, predicting end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.

Options Tied to BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Surge to Nearly 50% of Deribit's BTC Open Interest in Two Months
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:26 14 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission-approved BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has launched regulated crypto products that are gaining popularity. As of November 19, there were over 2 million open or active IBIT options contracts, worth around $11 billion. This represents nearly half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market, which is valued at $23 billion. The growth in demand for IBIT options is largely driven by US retail traders seeking regulated markets, and it's challenging Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market. However, Deribit's CEO notes that the activation of IBIT options has created positive effects, such as introducing new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants. The majority of activity is concentrated in short-dated options, indicating a demand for lower-priced options.

Is Bitcoin Bottom In? BTC's Price Action is Inverse of December Peak Above $108K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06:21 14 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent price action of Bitcoin (BTC) and whether its weakness has run its course. BTC's price initially fell due to investment banks scaling back expectations for Fed rate cuts, but then surged back up to $94,000 by the end of the day, leaving behind a "long-legged Doji candle" that is often seen as a potential signal of a bottom. The article notes that this pattern has emerged at a key support level and after a notable price drop, which could indicate that the downtrend has exhausted and buyers are taking control. To confirm this, traders will be looking for a decisive move above Monday's high of $95,900. The article also mentions that BTC's demand-supply dynamics continue to lean bullishly, with corporate demand outpacing new coin supply, and price volatility may pick up again after the U.S. CPI report on January 15. Overall, the market is now focused on signs of stability to see further downside or upside.

U.S. Judges Demand SEC 'Explain Itself' for Rebuffing Requests for Crypto Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:45 13 Jan 2025

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was ordered by a circuit-court ruling on Monday to provide a thorough explanation for refusing to write regulations for assessing whether crypto assets are securities or not. The ruling came in response to Coinbase's formal request for the SEC to clarify its stance on crypto assets. The court partially sided with Coinbase, stating that instead of forcing the agency to make a rule, it should "explain itself" and provide clarity on its decision.

The SEC had refused to write regulations, leading to an unclear environment for the industry. The court's ruling called the SEC's actions "arbitrary and capricious," echoing language from another recent case involving Grayscale's application for a spot bitcoin ETF.

Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal welcomed the court's decision, stating that his company will review the outcome and determine next steps. The SEC has until now been led by Chair Gary Gensler, who is stepping down soon. This ruling could provide an opportunity for the new leadership to change the agency's course on crypto oversight.

The ruling also criticized the SEC's performance in this case, stating that instead of making a rule, it has sidestepped the process and pursued a de facto ban through enforcement.

U.S. Banking Should Ease Path for Crypto, Republican Taking Reins at FDIC Suggests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses Travis Hill, the senior Republican at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), who is set to take over as temporary chairman after current Chairman Martin Gruenberg steps down on January 19. Before taking over, Hill outlined his thoughts on pro-crypto policy and called for the FDIC to issue new guidance on digital assets. He criticized the agency's current approach of issuing individual letters to banks regarding their cryptocurrency dealings, which he believes has stifled innovation and led to a perception that the FDIC is closed to businesses related to blockchain technology. Hill suggested that instead of a piecemeal approach, the FDIC should clearly outline what activities are legally permissible and provide timely regulatory approvals. He also criticized the agency's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, stating that efforts to debank law-abiding customers are unacceptable.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin, saying it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by criminals such as sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware hackers. This stance is consistent with his long-standing opposition to Bitcoin, despite the bank's profits from its use as a financial product. JPMorgan has even rebranded its blockchain platform to focus on real-world tokenization and plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities in 2025. Dimon's comments come ahead of Donald Trump's expected more favorable regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which may contrast with the bank's continued skepticism towards Bitcoin.
