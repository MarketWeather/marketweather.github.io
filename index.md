Bitcoin Under Pressure as Goldman Trims Fed Rate Cut Expectations, BofA Sees Potential Hike After Blowout Jobs Report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the impact of a strong jobs report in the United States on the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). The jobs report showed a significant increase in nonfarm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate, which led to a reassessment of expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. As a result, major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan revised their predictions, with some expecting an extended pause or even a rate hike.

The article states that Bitcoin dipped below $93,000, representing a 1.6% drop on the day, and was set to test the support zone near $92,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks major cryptocurrencies, was down over 3%. Other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, ADA, and DOGE also posted losses.

The jobs report prompted Goldman Sachs to push out its expected rate cut from March to June, while Bank of America (BofA) expects an extended pause or even a rate hike. ING noted that the market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed.

The article concludes by noting that the December consumer price index report, scheduled for release on January 15, will be closely watched for any signs of inflationary pressures, which could further impact the cryptocurrency market and interest rate expectations.

2025 Could be a Big Year for Crypto ETFs: Laser Digital
-------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 13 Jan 2025

According to a report from Laser Digital, a digital asset subsidiary of Nomura, 2025 could be a significant year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received over 12 filings for new crypto ETFs, which could be launched in the US if approved. These products include ETFs tracking the S&P 500's return in bitcoin, a combined bitcoin/ether fund, and others based on litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The report suggests that a bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to receive approval first. The success of previous spot bitcoin ETF launches, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, has paved the way for further growth in the ETF market. Additionally, the appointment of crypto-friendly regulators at the SEC may lead to a decrease in lawsuits against crypto companies and an increase in institutional investor adoption of ETFs.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 13 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

The Singaporean Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered local internet service providers to block access to Polymarket, a prediction market platform. This move follows similar actions taken by authorities in Taiwan and France. In Singapore, users who attempt to access Polymarket will be warned that they are accessing an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed provider, with penalties of up to SGD 10,000 or 6 months in jail for those found guilty. The GRA has not made a public announcement on the issue, but it is believed that this move is intended to prevent Singaporeans from using the platform. This adds to the growing list of jurisdictions cracking down on Polymarket, including Taiwan's arrest of 17 people for betting on its presidential election and ongoing investigations in the US.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 13 Jan 2025

The market for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) is expected to experience increased volatility this week due to the upcoming unlock schedule of several coins, including Ondo Finance's ONDO token. According to Tokenomist, the total value of tokens set to be unlocked is $3 billion, with ONDO accounting for a large share of that amount. On January 18, 1.94 billion ONDO tokens worth $2.23 billion will be released, which is equivalent to over 130% of the token's circulating supply. This sudden release of tokens could lead to price swings and market instability. The unlock schedule is designed to prevent rapid price changes by gradually releasing frozen tokens, but in this case, the large size of the unlock may still cause volatility.

Trump's Treasury Pick to Divest Bitcoin ETF Holdings to Eliminate Conflict of Interest: Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 13 Jan 2025

Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Treasury Secretary, plans to sell off several assets to avoid potential conflicts of interest. In his ethics agreement and financial disclosure forms, Bessent revealed investments worth over $700 million, including a stake in Bitcoin ETFs valued between $250,000 to $500,000. Other investments that could pose conflicts include a margin loan with Goldman Sachs, an account for trading China's currency, and a stake in the conservative publisher All Seasons. If confirmed, Bessent has promised to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. As Treasury Secretary, he would face challenges managing the growing federal debt and implementing Trump's tax plans.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Usual Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, experienced a backlash from its community after making a change to its yield-generating token, USD0++. The change, which allowed for early redemption of locked-up tokens at a lower price, was not well-received by investors and liquidity providers. As a result, the value of USD0++ dropped briefly below $0.90, while the protocol's governance token, USUAL, fell as much as 17%. The controversy arose from a lack of transparency around the change, which caught many off guard.

The issue surrounds the protocol's design, where stakers receive locked-up tokens (USD0++) that can only be redeemed after four years. However, the new "dual-path exit" feature allows for early redemption at a lower price, effectively changing the rules mid-game. This has led to concerns about the stability of the peg and the potential for market manipulation.

The Usual team apologized for any confusion and emphasized that they had communicated the change in advance from October. Despite this, many investors remain concerned about the lack of transparency and the potential risks associated with DeFi products. The incident serves as a reminder for crypto investors to be aware of the rules and potential changes surrounding these high-yield investment opportunities.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position in a week. During his 11-month tenure, he oversaw several high-profile cryptocurrency cases, including a lawsuit against Binance and the conclusion of enforcement work against collapsed platform FTX. McGinley characterized the FTX case as the largest recovery for victims in CFTC history. The agency has also taken action against other crypto projects such as KuCoin and Falcon Labs. His departure opens up opportunities for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement efforts, particularly with Trump appointees potentially taking over the chairmanship. The CFTC could become a dominant player in overseeing US digital assets markets if crypto legislation passes in 2025.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

As Donald Trump prepares to take office, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that could significantly impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a steady asset's value, typically the US dollar. This would require stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers to comply with consumer protections and disclosures.

The proposed regulation suggests that "funds" under existing law should include not only traditional currencies but also stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as long as they operate as a medium of exchange or means of payment. Additionally, the proposal defines "accounts" to include virtual currency wallets used for retail transactions, requiring institutions providing such accounts to make consumer disclosures and provide protections against unauthorized transactions.

The proposal has sparked debate, with some advocacy groups welcoming the move, citing the need to protect consumers and level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms. However, others have criticized the proposal as overly broad and failing to consider decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

The fate of this proposal is uncertain, given that Trump will soon appoint a new CFPB chief, who may choose to scrap or modify it. Even if finalized, the regulation could be overturned by Congress using its Congressional Review Act authority.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is set to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a regulatory framework for the industry, according to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi. This shift comes after the government previously warned against the use of cryptocurrencies in 2015. The new legislation aims to capitalize on the potential benefits of virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. Kenya launched a draft policy on VAs and VASPs in December, which seeks to establish a fair and competitive market for cryptocurrency industry players and foster innovation and financial literacy. The country's cautious stance towards cryptocurrencies has been easing, with lawmakers considering taxing crypto in 2022 as the industry continues to grow, with around 8.5% of Kenyans owning cryptocurrencies.

3 Russians Face Money Laundering Charges Over Mixing Services: DOJ
------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US Department of Justice has charged three Russian nationals with money laundering in connection with operating sanctioned cryptocurrency mixing services Blender.io and Sinbad.io. Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik were arrested last month, while Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov is at-large. The services, which aim to anonymize transactions, had previously been used by North Korean hackers to conceal the proceeds of cyber thefts. Blender.io was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022 for aiding in the concealment of these funds, marking the first time a crypto mixer had been sanctioned. The defendants are accused of operating safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including those from ransomware and wire fraud attacks. The case highlights ongoing tensions between policymakers and advocates for financial privacy, with some arguing that targeting crypto mixing services is an overreach and others seeing it as necessary to combat cybercrime.

Babylon Labs Brings New Momentum to Bitcoin ZK Tech Through Bridge to Cosmos Chains
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Babylon Labs, a developer of the largest BTC staking protocol, is working on a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin network and the Cosmos network. This bridge will enable interoperability between the two networks, allowing for the transfer of value between them. To achieve this, Babylon is using BitVM2, a computing paradigm that enables smart contracts on Bitcoin, similar to those on Ethereum.

The goal is to unlock the value stored in Bitcoin and use it to finance other ecosystems and applications. This move is part of a broader effort to extract greater utility from Bitcoin, similar to what's seen on networks like Ethereum.

Babylon's BTC staking protocol has already achieved significant success, with a total value locked (TVL) of around $5.5 billion. The introduction of BitVM2 has been hailed as a breakthrough for making Bitcoin more programmable and enabling faster and cheaper transactions without compromising security.

The development of this bridge is expected to pave the way for zero-knowledge technology, which allows different parties to verify information without revealing what that information is. This will be crucial for bridging digital assets between blockchains.

Other developers are also building on BitVM2, including Citrea, a zero-knowledge rollup backed by Galaxy Digital, which deployed a BitVM-based bridge to the Bitcoin testnet last September. The goal is to create a seamless experience for users to transfer value and applications between the two networks.

Bybit to Temporarily Halt Crypto Trading in India, Citing Regulations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Here is a summary of the article:

Crypto exchange Bybit, based in Dubai, announced it will temporarily suspend services for its Indian users starting Sunday. The suspension means customers in India won't be able to open new trades or access products on the platform, but they can still withdraw funds. This move is in response to regulations in India that require crypto companies to register as Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with anti-money laundering measures. Bybit plans to finalize its registration process and resume full services once complete.

U.S. Added 256K Jobs in December, Blowing Past 160K Estimate
------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The US job market saw significant growth in December, with employers adding 256,000 jobs, exceeding economists' forecasts of 160,000. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly dropped to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in November. This news caused a reaction in financial markets, with bitcoin's price falling over 2% to $92,800 and traditional stock index futures dropping around 1%. The bond market saw a 9-basis-point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.78%, while the dollar index surged 0.6% higher. Gold prices also moved modestly lower to just below $2,700 per ounce. The strong jobs report has led investors to reevaluate their bets on further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025, with odds of a March rate cut falling to 28% from 41%, and May rate cut odds declining to 34% from 44%. Additionally, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December, up 3.9% year-over-year.

XRP, XLM and DOGE See Recovery in Stateside Demand
--------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article reports on a positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for three alternative cryptocurrencies: XRP, DOGE, and XLM. The prices of these tokens have recovered from steep discounts seen on Coinbase, a US-based exchange, and are now trading at similar levels on both Coinbase and Binance, a major offshore exchange. This suggests that US investors are again participating in the market, driving up demand and prices. The article uses charts to illustrate this phenomenon, specifically the "Coinbase premium indicator", which measures the spread between Coinbase and Binance prices for each token.

'Razzlekhan' Drops Video As Rapper Prepares for Prison in Bitfinex Hack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

Heather Morgan, also known as Razzlekhan, has released a new music video despite being sentenced to 18 months in prison for laundering cryptocurrency stolen from Bitfinex. Her husband, Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein, was convicted of orchestrating the hack and theft. The song, "Razzlekhan vs. The United States," is part of Morgan's musical persona that she claims is meant as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on her experiences throughout their federal case. In the video, Morgan raps about feeling trapped by the system and appeals to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and X.com, for help. Despite apologizing in court and expressing regret for her role in concealing the stolen fortune, Morgan's reputation has been damaged due to public fixation on her rapper character. She is set to report to prison at the end of January, where she will have restricted computer use and monitoring.

Bitcoin Registers 14 Green Hourly Candles, Longest Streak Since 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses an unusual price movement in the Bitcoin market on January 9-10, where the BTCUSD pair on Coinbase had a streak of 14 consecutive green hourly candles, indicating gains in each hour. This trend started at 21:00 UTC on January 9 and continued until 10:00 UTC on January 10, with the price increasing from $91,771 to $95,283. According to Vetle Lunde, Senior Analyst at K33 Research, this is currently the longest hourly green candle streak since January 1, 2017, and it's not the first time double-digit hourly green candles have been seen in recent times. However, the trend may be ending with a red hourly candle now due to finish at 12:00 UTC on January 10.

Sentiment Readings Favor Dogecoin Gains as Cardano’s ADA Leads Market Bump
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Dogecoin (DOGE). According to analytics firm Santiment, DOGE has been quiet for the past month, experiencing a 28% decline in its market capitalization since reaching its peak. However, the firm notes that crowd sentiment is at its lowest point over the past year, suggesting that there may be upside potential if crypto markets trend upward again.

Large investors, or "whales," are showing increased interest in DOGE, with transactions over $100,000 spiking to hint at potential price bumps in the short term. Futures markets for DOGE have also set a new record for open interest, although they have since tapered off alongside a market-wide decline.

The article also touches on other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL). Bitcoin is neutral after a dip and recovery, while Ether sees bearish sentiment despite prices holding above $3,000. XRP is bullish after an 18% rise in the past week, and Binance Coin ($BNB) shows neutral sentiment post-drop below $700.

The article concludes by noting that Cardano's ADA led a market-wide recovery on Friday with a 5.5% move, while Solana's SOL rose 1%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) also rose 1.04%, with some AI Agent tokens showing significant growth, such as Bixby, Cookie DAO's COOKIE, and ChainGPT, which rose up to 50% on Binance spot listings.

EU's MiCA Rules Will Likely Boost Euro Denominated Stablecoins, JPMorgan Says
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses how the EU's new MiCA regulations have impacted the stablecoin market. Specifically, it highlights how the rules have favored compliant stablecoins, such as Circle's EURC, and hindered non-compliant ones like Tether's EURT.

As of December 30, only stablecoins that meet certain requirements can be used in regulated markets in the EU. This means that issuers must maintain significant reserves in European banks and secure licenses for trading. As a result, Tether has discontinued its EURT stablecoin and delisted USDT from many EU-based exchanges.

Despite these challenges, Tether remains a major player in the global stablecoin market, particularly in Asian markets where regulations are less strict. The company has also invested in MiCA-compliant stablecoin issuers like Quantoz Payments and StablR to maintain its presence in the EU. JPMorgan analysts expect euro-denominated stablecoins to benefit from these developments.

Bitcoin Data Indicates Ripe Buying Period as BTC Nears $95K
-----------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the current state of the Bitcoin market and whether it's a good time to buy or sell. Despite some recent fluctuations, data suggests that investors who have held Bitcoin for less than six months are selling at a loss, which historically has preceded price recoveries. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has reached 0.987, indicating that short-term investors are experiencing pain and may be more likely to sell, creating buying opportunities.

Other indicators, such as Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and Puell Multiple, also suggest that the market is not yet at its peak and that a correction does not necessarily mean the end of the bullish cycle. In fact, the short-term SOPR suggests that capitulation or a market bottom may be near.

The article notes that fresh economic data has caused a drop in risk assets such as Bitcoin, but experts believe that this could be a buying opportunity for those looking to enter the market. The release of US non-farm payrolls (NFP) later Friday is expected to influence trading decisions, with strong numbers potentially leading to interest rate hikes and negatively impacting Bitcoin prices.

Overall, the data suggests that current price levels may be a good time to buy Bitcoin, as short-term investors are selling at a loss and historical trends indicate that this could precede a price recovery.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Briefly Went Negative, Usually Marks a Local Bottom: Van Straten
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date : 00:00 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the volatility of Bitcoin's (BTC) price movements, particularly its swings between $90,000 and $100,000. The sentiment around Bitcoin tends to flip from bullish to bearish when it approaches these valuation levels. Derivatives, such as futures and options, play a significant role in these price swings.

The article highlights the importance of the perpetual funding rate, which is used to gauge market sentiment. A positive funding rate indicates traders believe the price will continue to rise, while a negative funding rate suggests they expect the price to fall. During bull markets, the funding rate tends to be positive, but during bear markets, it can turn negative.

Recently, the funding rate briefly went negative for the first time this year, triggering a leverage flush and sentiment shift before Bitcoin's price moved back above $94,000. This brief period of negative funding rates is similar to what was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.

The article concludes that negative funding rates can signal a continued bear market or an immediate bottom, while positive rates may indicate strong demand but not necessarily a overheated market. The emergence of a floor tends to occur when the funding rate turns negative and bears become overconfident, leading to liquidation and price rebounds.
