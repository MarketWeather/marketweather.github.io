----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18:06 13 Jan 2025

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is set to have new management, with Vice Chairman Travis Hill expected to take over as temporary or permanent chairman. Before taking the reins, Hill expressed his thoughts on pro-crypto policies, calling for the agency to issue new guidance for digital assets and move away from its current piecemeal approach. He criticized the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients, saying it is unacceptable and goes against the goal of decreasing the number of unbanked individuals. Hill also emphasized the need for clear and transparent regulations that allow for innovation and timely approvals. The FDIC's longtime Chairman Martin Gruenberg will step down on January 19, with Hill taking over as interim chairman until a permanent replacement is named.

Jamie Dimon Still Sees ‘No Value’ in Bitcoin
--------------------------------------------

17:47 13 Jan 2025

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated his negative views on Bitcoin (BTC), stating that it has "no intrinsic value" and is heavily used by sex traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware operators. This stance is consistent with his previous opposition to Bitcoin, unlike BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who had a change of heart. Despite this, JPMorgan Chase has profited from Bitcoin's growth as a financial product and has even partnered with BlackRock on a spot bitcoin ETF. The bank has also rebranded its blockchain platform to Kinexys, aiming to reduce limitations in the current financial infrastructure through real-world tokenization. Dimon's comments come just days before Donald Trump's expected return to the US presidency, which is likely to bring a friendlier regulatory environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

13:12 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

MicroStrategy, a company led by CEO Michael Saylor, has increased its bitcoin holdings for the tenth consecutive week. In the latest purchase, MicroStrategy bought 2,530 BTC (worth $243 million) at an average price of $95,972. This brings their total bitcoin holdings to 450,000 BTC, with an overall average purchase price of $62,691. Saylor also made a presentation at the ICR Conference, where he recommended investing in bitcoin instead of bonds, citing the significant increase in bitcoin's value since 2020. He referred to bonds as "toxic". The news caused MicroStrategy's shares to drop by nearly 5% and bitcoin's price to fall just above $90,000. Additionally, Semler Scientific, a separate company, acquired an additional 237 BTC at an average price of $98,267, bringing their total holdings to 2,321 BTC.

Bitcoin Difficulty Hits All-Time High, Adjusts Positively for 8th Consecutive Time
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10:58 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the recent surge in mining difficulty in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem. The mining difficulty has risen to a new all-time high of 110.45 trillion, making it approximately 110.45 trillion times harder than at the time of Bitcoin's genesis block. This is the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty, which puts pressure on miners as the industry becomes more competitive.

The article also notes that some publicly traded miners have diversified into other industries such as high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to the increased competition. Additionally, MARA Holdings has issued convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and is optimizing revenue by lending out its Bitcoin to earn single-digit yields.

Historically, similar consecutive positive adjustments in difficulty have occurred before cycle tops and bottoms in the past. However, there is no clear trend that emerges from this data. The article also notes that the continued strength of the hashrate, a measure of the network's mining power, suggests that 1 zettahash per second can be reached before the next halving event.

Overall, the article highlights the ongoing competitiveness in the Bitcoin mining industry and the potential for further growth in the network's mining power.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09:57 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

The value of Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.6% to below $93,000 on Monday after major investment banks reassessed their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts following a strong jobs report released Friday. The report showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 in December, beating expectations and leading some banks to push back the expected date of the next interest rate cut from March to June. Goldman Sachs reduced its forecast for rate cuts in 2025, while Bank of America (BofA) expects the Fed to pause or even hike rates due to concerns about inflation. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks major cryptocurrencies like XRP, ADA, and DOGE, was down over 3% on Monday. Traditional markets were also affected, with the S&P 500 futures trading lower and the dollar index nearing a 4-year high.

-------------------------------------------------------

08:51 13 Jan 2025

Here's a summary of the article:

Laser Digital, a subsidiary of financial services giant Nomura, predicts that 2025 could be a big year for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US. According to their report, over 12 crypto ETFs have been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with potential products including ones based on bitcoin, ether, litecoin, XRP, and Solana. A bitcoin/ether ETF is likely to be approved first. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year was a success, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust amassing $53 billion in assets under management. With the appointment of crypto-friendly SEC chairman Paul Atkins and the expected resolution of ongoing lawsuits against crypto companies, Laser Digital believes that new ETFs will be more likely to get approved. The report also predicts continued growth of the ETF market, with wider adoption by institutional investors in 2025.

Singapore Blocks Polymarket, Following Taiwan and France
--------------------------------------------------------

08:16 13 Jan 2025

The Singapore Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) has ordered internet service providers to block access to the prediction market platform Polymarket. The warning message informs users that attempting to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed provider is punishable with a fine of up to SGD 10,000 or a jail sentence of up to 6 months. This move follows Taiwan's decision to actively block its nationals from using Polymarket, as well as gaming authorities in France restricting access to the platform. Additionally, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed Coinbase for information on U.S. nationals trading on Polymarket, as part of an ongoing investigation.

Altcoin Market Could Heat Up This Week With $3B Token Unlock Schedule, ONDO Leads the Charge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

07:02 13 Jan 2025

The article discusses the upcoming token unlock schedule for alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), which is expected to release billions of dollars worth of supply into the market. The largest unlock is for Ondo Finance's ONDO token, which will free up 1.94 billion tokens worth $2.23 billion, representing over 130% of its circulating supply. This large unlock could lead to increased volatility in the market, as it is significantly larger than ONDO's daily trading volume and may cause a rapid increase in supply that could put downward pressure on prices. As of press time, ONDO's price has fallen 5% for the day and 15% month-to-date, representing a significant decline from its record highs last week. The article notes that unlocks can sometimes lead to increased volatility, especially when the released tokens are equivalent to 100% of the average daily volume.

Scott Bessent, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, is planning to sell several assets, including his investment in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Bessent filed an ethics agreement and financial disclosures, revealing assets worth over $700 million, including a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and investments in China's currency and a conservative publisher. He has promised to avoid any conflict of interest if confirmed for the Treasury Secretary position. As a pro-crypto advocate, Bessent would face the challenge of managing the federal debt amidst Trump's plans to extend tax cuts and eliminate taxes on social security benefits.

Red-Hot DeFi Platform Usual Faces Backlash as Protocol Update Triggers Sell-Off
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22:26 10 Jan 2025

The article discusses the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual Protocol and its recent controversy. The protocol allows users to stake their funds and earn rewards in the form of its USD0 and USUAL tokens. However, the introduction of a new feature called "dual-path exit" allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a discounted price, which caught many off guard.

The change caused a sell-off on secondary markets, with the protocol's yield-generating token USD0++ falling briefly below 90 cents from $1. The governance token USUAL plummeted as much as 17% before recovering some of its losses. The sudden change in the redemption mechanism sparked criticism across DeFi users for changing the design without warning.

The Usual team claimed that the change was communicated in advance, but many investors felt that the communication was not adequate. The controversy highlights the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels.

Some key takeaways from the article include:

* The introduction of the "dual-path exit" feature allowed investors to redeem their locked-up tokens early at a discounted price.
* The change caught many off guard, causing a sell-off on secondary markets.
* The protocol's total value locked (TVL) dropped below $1.6 billion.
* The controversy highlights the potential risks of DeFi products that entice users with high-yields via token incentives and rewards flywheels.

Overall, the episode serves as a lesson for crypto investors to be aware of the potential risks associated with DeFi products and to thoroughly understand the rules and mechanisms before investing.

U.S. Enforcement Chief Behind CFTC Crypto Cases Exits Before Trump Arrives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

21:41 10 Jan 2025

Ian McGinley, Enforcement Director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is leaving his position in a week. During his relatively short tenure, which began in February 2023, he oversaw several high-profile cases related to cryptocurrency, including lawsuits against Binance and FTX. The CFTC has also pursued actions against other crypto projects, such as KuCoin and Falcon Labs. McGinley's departure opens the door for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a new chair is appointed. The role of Chair may go to one of three sitting Republican commissioners: Caroline Pham, Summer Mersinger, or former Commissioner Brian Quintenz. The CFTC's focus on digital assets has been a priority during McGinley's tenure, and if crypto legislation advances in 2025, the agency could potentially surpass the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the dominant regulator of US digital asset markets.

Biden's Consumer Watchdog Pushes for Last-Minute Stablecoin Rule
----------------------------------------------------------------

21:22 10 Jan 2025

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed new regulations that would impact stablecoin issuers and wallet providers. The proposal aims to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to virtual wallets and stablecoins, which are digital tokens tied to a stable asset like the US dollar. This could have significant implications for the way US-based stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers operate.

The proposal suggests that stablecoins should be treated as a payment mechanism, similar to traditional currencies. It also proposes extending EFTA protections to virtual currency wallets used for retail transactions, such as person-to-person transfers or buying goods and services.

The regulation would require institutions providing these accounts to make consumer disclosures, provide protections against unauthorized transactions, and allow users to cancel improper transfers. This could conflict with the decentralized nature of some crypto operations, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that operate without outside interference.

The proposal is still in its early stages, and it's unclear whether it will be finalized under the Trump administration. The CFPB director, Rohit Chopra, appears unlikely to step down voluntarily, but Trump could appoint a new director who might revise or reject the proposal.

Several organizations have weighed in on the proposal. Consumer advocacy group Better Markets has applauded the move, saying it would level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms and protect consumers. The Cato Institute's Jack Solowey has criticized the proposal, calling its arguments "embarrassingly conclusory" and failing to address decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets.

Overall, the proposal has sparked debate in the crypto community, with some seeing it as a step towards greater regulation and consumer protection, while others view it as an overreach by the government.

Kenya Prepares to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in Policy Shift: Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------

17:53 10 Jan 2025

Kenya is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a regulatory framework to govern the industry. This shift comes after previous warnings against cryptocurrency use, with the country's central bank stating in 2015 that these assets were not legal tender. According to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, Kenya aims to create a "fair, competitive and stable market" for cryptocurrency players and foster innovation and financial literacy. The government has launched a draft policy on virtual assets and service providers, which seeks to capitalize on the industry's potential benefits while mitigating risks such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud. With approximately 8.5% of Kenyans owning cryptocurrencies, lawmakers are considering a law to tax crypto as the industry continues to grow in the country.
